negative,"Sorry but this one is not a keeper. Besides having no flavor,I dont know what I was thinking cooking the beans for an hour in the soupthere was nothing left but mush. I was disapointed"
negative,"I made this tonight for a benefit dinner and THANK GOD I made an extra one for home. It was HORRIBLE. I followed the recipe to a T and the sugar carmelized and turned to a burnt brown goo, well before the flour even bagan to set.My chickens even turned up their beaks at it. I'm sorry to be so critical but YUCK!"
negative,I love all of these ingredients separately but together...It was incredibly harsh/acrid to the taste buds.
negative,"Way too much batter for one pan but I did put it all in one pan, against my better judgement, and it never got done. The batter was so good though that I will try it again in two 9x5 bread pans or a bundt pan and bake at 350 degrees for an hour like you normally would."
negative,Not good. Way to much vinegar and nothing much after that.
negative,This was not at all what I expected. I followed the recipe EXACTLY and I did not care for the flavor or texture. The worcestershire was overpowering. i had about 5 bites and had to throw out the entire batch. I will not be making this again.
negative,"I had very high expectations after reading the reviews...I can't believe no one said waaay toooo much soup! I followed the directions, except for adding a second can of clams... even with the extra clams, all I taste is the soup. I'm headed to the store to buy 2 more cans of clams in hopes to salvage what I have here."
negative,"Sorry, but this was completely flat.No one would eat it."
negative,"I was really looking forward to these, but we were quite disappointed.I followed the recipe exactly, but the batter was really bland.I added a little nutmeg and allspice and some more cinnamon.The batter was very runny for donuts, but I hoped it would thicken up when chilled.When I tried to roll out the chilled dough, it was not really dough, but still thick batter.I couldn't make donuts because it wasn't thick enough.We made all donut holes, and they were extremely bland."
negative,Tried out making the ravioli before starting the sauce to make sure it would be a good meal (just in case we had to order takeout). Unfortunately the ravioli were not good at all. I honestly think it was the wonton wrappers. They were way too thick and gummy for a ravioli.
negative,i didnt have the same experience as the rest of u when it came to this recipe...i made it 3 times just to make sure i followed it correctly...
negative,"My usual recipe for aebelskivers is from the Make-a-Mix cookbook, which is out of print. It has you make pancake mix (with powdered buttermilk) and then add the wet ingredients. I was out of buttermilk powder, so I used this one, and it's just not anywhere near as good. For one, it doesn't call for salt, which was badly needed. For two, it didn't involve beating the egg whites separate from the yolks, which gives the aebelskivers a very light and airy texture; these were kind of heavy. I like the cardamom, but I'll just add it to my regular recipe."
negative,Followed recipe except ground hot pepper and did not like it at all. Just a kind of bitter bad taste.
negative,"This recipe, as written, does not work.I didn't have one 6oz box of chocolate pudding so I used one 4oz box of chocolate and two 1oz boxes of white chocolate pudding. Other than that I made as directed. Unfortunately, after baking for 1-1/2 hours the cakes were dried out and cracked; close to solid bricks. You could pick up the cake and eat it like a giant cookie (which my 16 yr old actually did to taste it). I've never before baked a cake (even a quick bread) for this amount of time so I suspect that the real problem with this recipe is the 1-1/2 hours bake time. If I see that it is adjusted in the future I would be willing to try this recipe again, but for now we're unemployed and I'm afraid it was a lot of ingredients that is just going in the trash. :( Made for Fall 2009 Pick A Chef. http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=310505andpostdays=0andpostorder=ascandstart=0"
negative,"I just made this recipe. There isn't enough milk and there is no way you can get 3 apples in this.I've added in total about 3/4 cup milk,and only one apple."
negative,"This did not turn out well for my family.Based on the other reviews, I cooked the chops for only 4 hours and they were still on the dry side.Also, based previous reviews, I was worried about the sodium.I didn't have low-sodium soy sauce so I halved the recommended amount and this recipe was still too salty.I really like the ease of preparation, but alas, this will not be going on the rotation."
negative,"Bland.Boring.Probably should have added vinegar but at the end of the day, it's cabbage, potatoes and kielbasa."
negative,"Sorry, this didn't work out for us at all!I did use natural peanut butter, so maybe that's why they didn't work.The recipe seems to suggest that any kind of peanut butter would work, but Smucker's natural PB doesn't work at all!I expect PB cookies to be a little crumbly in texture, but these could barely be picked up without crumbling to bits.They tasted okay, but they weren't as good as PB cookies made from other recipes that I've tried.This was the first time I've used a PB cookie recipe with so few ingredients, though.I'm glad I tried them, but I wouldn't make them again."
negative,"Well the house smelled wonderful while this was baking but the finished product was quite disappointing.My grand kids didn't like it at all. I thought it was ""okay""."
negative,"Wow, did it taste good! However, there must be a mistake with the recipe. Both times I made it, it comes out the consistency of sludge with chunks of butter marbled in it. I really dont' recommend this one"
positive,"Take 1 -Made as directed but the mix was way to soft to make into potato cakes (would recommend 1/4 cup of milk if any) so put the mix in a casserole dish and sprinkled with the wholemeal/wholegrain breadcrumbs and warmed in a low oven to warm the mix through and brown the breadcrumbs - great mash.Take 2 - had about a quarter of the mix over and though still delicate was able to make 6 potato cakes, though chilled well before cooking to firm them up and they took a matter of minutes to cook to a beautiful golden brown.In making the 6 I only used 1/2 and egg and about a cup of breadcrumbs, so would recommend 2 to 3 eggs and 4 cups of crumbs.Made a delightful snack as we watched telethon.Will be making again but will chill the mix before forming the cakes, thinking these could also be made up and frozen as a OAMC then just defrost and cook.Thank you Tisme, made for Edition 9 - Make My Recipe."
positive,Great tasting soup !!! I like the idea of baking the tomatoes.This soup has great great flavor.You may want to check the tomatoes after 20 minutes. Mine were done in 25.It made for excellent comfort food on this chilly night.Made for PRMR tag.
positive,Made these tonight and served with ice cream.All I have to say is DELICIOUS !!!! Will definately try again.Made for PRMR tag.
positive,"Great soup recipe!I did have a little cabbage in the fridge that needed using up, so I threw that in, as well.I figured everything else was in it, why not!Thnx for sharing your recipe, Shakespearette. Made for PAC Fall 2009."
positive,"This is very rich, moist and flavorful for being lower fat and sugar.The orange flavor is great and the added texture from the whole wheat flour is nice.I used walnuts, but I think almonds would be good also.Served with no-sugar added Cool Whip."
positive,"This is by far the best icing I have ever tasted. It's the perfect amount of sweetness combined with the amazing combo of peanut butter and chocolate. Much better than any buttercream in my opinion, with the added benefit of monounsaturated fats instead of saturated (hey, anything to make the most fattening food in the world better for you!)."
positive,"I doubled the recipe and made jumbo cupcakes for a bake sale and they sold out in a hurry. I used cake flour instead of all- purpose, increased to amount of cocoa to 1/4 cup and topped them with gobs of cream cheese frosting. There were lots of happy customers with a sugar high that day. Will use this recipe again and again. Update: I've also made a few 3-layer red velvet cakes using this recipe. My friends now say I make the best red velvet cake in town."
positive,Yum!!!
positive,WOW!This was incredible!I have to say that I was skeptical at first as I put the recipe together.But I had faith in the recipe and all the great reviews and it turned out great!I also used french vanilla pudding and it was fantastic!No one believed the recipe was so simple - it took me 10 minutes total to make this.Be sure to refrigerate overnight.This is a keeper - definitely a family favorite now
positive,"Excellent recipe. Very tasty! I like my cookies bigger than ""chips ahoy"" size. So this batch only made about 2 1/2 dozen vice 3. I think I will try this recipe with Nutella. Because no matter how good a recipe is I like to tweem 'em to see if I can make 'em even better."
positive,So good and healthy!!My BF loved these tacos.I reduced the marinade into a sauce (I simmered and boiled the sauce until the sauce thickened with a 1-2 tbl of cornstarch) and served a little sauce on top of the tacos.Thank you for this recipe.
positive,Really good!!! Everyone loved it!
positive,"This salad looks beautiful and is bursting with flavour. I can't think of a thing I would change. I used jarred roasted peppers, red kidney beans and grated cheddar cheese> 4 of us ate most of it and I enjoyed the little there was leftover for my lunch at work today. I think the flavours were even better after a night in the fridge."
positive,Loved this! One thing I especially enjoyed was removing the peel and pith from the lemons left a nice lemon flavour without that sort of harshness you can get from the rind sometimes. Only thing I did differently was serve with a salad but I imagine it would go really well with mashed potatoes as suggested too.
positive,"Delicious!!I took this cake to a B-B-Q this afternoon and it was a huge hit.I'm glad I took a piece for myself when I brought the cake out, because it was gone so fast that if I had waited I would have missed out.This cake was moist, rich, and oh so yummy!I baked this in two 9"" round cake pansand it tested done after about 32 mins.Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe...it is definitely a keeper!!*Made for Fall 2009 PAC*"
positive,"Wow these were amazing. The spice balance was perfect. I did make some changes to the recipe. I used 50ml of oil instead of 80ml(next time will use less), and turmeric instead of paprika. I fried a chopped onion together with the garlic and after adding the spices I added some chopped tomatoes. I added around 100ml white wine and water to get enough sauce to serve over the rice. I left the shells on the prawns. I used 1kg of prawns to get two servings and there was none left. Thanks for posting, will make again."
positive,"One can always trust Kittencal's Recipes even if you've never made them before!! I've never made homemade marinara sauce before and this was just delicious!! I omitted the wine, used 1/2 the amount of tomatoes and 1 1/2 times the amount of the tomato paste.This was a great sauce that I will make everytime i want marinara sauce.I served it with Recipe#59359.Thanks Kittencal! "
positive,"A great Ravioli dough recipe that was very easy and very yummy.The dough was very easy to work with and formed raviolis nicely.However, I used a filling recipe similar to what one of the previous reviewers mentioned: I mixed a boiled, shredded chicken with an egg, parmesan cheese, italian seasoning and some cheddar cheese. The only problem that I encountered was that I did not roll the dough thin enough and did not fill the pockets enough which left air pockets in the ravioli.Next time I will make sure I roll it thin enough and fill it properly.Served it with Kittencal's Marinara Pasta Sauce (Vegetarian) Recipe#136292."
positive,Pot Roast/Pot Belly...I'm thinking something's synonymous in there for me.Made for Everyday Is A Holiday.
positive,"Delicious! I didn't have any ginger so used some 5 spice powder -- didn't measure but about 1 tsp or so. I didn't freeze the chicken, just marinated it for half a day in the fridge. Thanks for sharing this keeper!"
neutral,I thought these would be great-I love lime.Found them to be a little bland in the end.I was trying to doctor them up with more flavor before putting them on the table.I will not be making these again.
neutral,I guess that I was expecting stellar due to the reviews but it was nothing super special.Edible but won't be part of our regular rotation.
neutral,"These were just OK.Not anything wrong with them, just not amazing."
neutral,"I made these for a potluck, they were good but I was expecting more."
neutral,"My rice didn't turn out so hot. It was mushy (maybe my fault) but my real issue was it was the brightest neon orange color - it looked like it would glow in the dark - not visually appealing at all. However, DH's father is from Mexico and he threw it in a skillet and fried it until it had a dark, crisp crust - like a rice patty. The flavor was good and we ate most of it but I don't know if I will try this one again. Sorry."
neutral,"That's cute, the title and the torte is delicous too.I served it with pico de Gallo on top"
neutral,I thought that this was just ok.I just started on weight watchers so I'm getting used to trying new things.But of couse I did do a boo boo.I accidently used tablespoons instead of teaspoons of the lemon juice.Thank goodness that I at least like lemon juice.I bet it will be better next time if I used less LJ.
neutral,"This was fine.Not great, not bad, just fine.They taste like a traditional fat free chocolate cake.Kind of spongy and not a ton of flavor, but the kids like it and I love the nutritionals."
neutral,"This a basic good recipe, to spice it up a little I used Jimmy Dean Hot sausage and sharp cheddar cheese and just a dash of garlic. Try it."
neutral,"This was tasty, but I found myself wanting some tomato in there, too... maybe a 1/2 cup of chunky tomato sauce spread over the bottom before adding the filling. The dough is VERY wet and shaggy and hard to work with - it sticks to everything. The rising time is short because of the massive amount of yeast (1.25 oz = about 4 packets worth); it might be better with one packet of yeast and a couple hours for the first rise; slower rises have more time for flavor development. I didn't have a 10"" springform, so I used a 9"" cake pan. This led to two problems: I couldn't fit all the filling in, and the bottom stuck to the pan and tore when I was trying to remove it, despite greasing and applying cornmeal to the pan. Even though the outside stuck to the pan, the center of the base on the inside was still wet and doughy. I enjoyed the flavors, though, and might play with it to make it work better. Made for Pick-A-Chef Fall 2009."
neutral,Stephanie...I am not sure these are the cookies for my family.I found them very sweet and they bake out pretty flat.Your instructions do not include for adding the brown and white sugars so I creamed it together with the egg mixture before adding the flour.1/2 cup of chips is definitely not a lot for these cookies either - I had many with no chips at all.It is a good thought to lighten them up but I think it just changes what I think is a chocolate chip cookie.Made for PAC Fall 2009
neutral,"This was incredibly rich for enchiladas, but pretty easy to do. I might omit the jalapenos next time and just sprinkle on chili powder or something as personal preference"
neutral,I think a nice addition to this recipe would be buttermilk powder.This is better than storebought which is full of salt and MSG
neutral,"I'd love to give this a higher rating, but it was way sweeter than I had anticipated. I enjoyed the flavor combination, but found there was a bit too much sauce. Next time I'd definitely add double the bok choy, hopefully thatd even things out."
neutral,"DH and I thought this was okay.Nothing spectacular, but it was a nice change from the usual ho-hum canned corn. Thanks for posting!"
neutral,I used this marinade on some ribeyes that I grilled for dinner.I marinated them for about 8 hours.DH and I thought this marinade was just okay.It wasn't bad but it didn't blow us away either.I may use it again.Thanks for posting!
neutral,Tasty meatloaf. Mine fell apart after slicing it.We liked the flavour and added parmesan cheese.Made for Pac Fall 2009
neutral,"I have all of Ina's books and adore them.I have made many of her recipes which are ""special"", however in this case, even though it looked stunning I found it to be far to coffeeish.Now I make a dynamite brownie recipe using coffee and it just brings out the chocolate, this is far too much.You really notice it.Linda"
neutral,"These were OK, but too difficult to work with.They break apart easily, burn too fast and aren't as fluffy as I was expecting.I don't think I'd bother with this recipe again.The flavor is good, but the texture isn't great."
neutral,"I was about to post this recipe for safekeeping as I found it in a book entitled ""Historic Virginia Inns: A Cook's Tour"" (1986). It was accredited to the Williamsburg Inn. I haven't made these yet but I definitely plan to! Thanks for saving me the trouble of inputting! UPDATE: I made these and I'm not as impressed as I want to be. Followed the recipe with the exception of the cinnamon sugar on top (timing issue). They did come out flat as others posted but the flavor was only alright. Kinda bland. Don't know why since everyone else's came out so flavorful. Maybe it was the brand of sweet potatoes I used"
