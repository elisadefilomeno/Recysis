"This was a fine sandwich, I'll definitely be making it again. I think you could also use blue cheese rather than goat or feta--blue seems to go well with roast beef.",positive
"Vastly superior to its bastard cousin the Twinkie Pie, this is a true delight to the ""Redneck-chic"" cook in all of us.My wife and girlfriends (inUtah, that is) were astounded.How could you possibly combine canned tuna with refined sugar, and then (italics there) add brine!""Recipezaar, baby- who needs the ocean?""Eli Totz",positive

This dish was lovely.All my guests complimented it.,positive
I made this recipe for 16 coworkers.I doubled the amounts of the ingrediants hoping to get 4 loaves.I only got 3 loaaves and the batter was hard to stir when it came to adding the walnuts and apples.The end result was excellent and the bread was consumed in a matter of minutes.Everybody loved the bread but they love it when anybody brings in homemade snacks.I was very happy with the taste of the bread.,positive
They taste better than they appear.,neutral
This recipe was excellant - enjoyed it very muchTHANKS !!!!!!!!!!,positive
I think I cooked the chicken too long so the breadcrumb mixture became a little too crispy. Be careful. I'd also increase the ratio of seasonings to chicken as I used a little less than was specified and had just enough mixture to cover the chicken.,neutral
"This recipe is very good.I recently been carfully watching my Cholesterol and modified it slightly.This is what I changed and it reduce the cholesterol content to 0.1/2 C soy milk in place of the 1/2 C milk.1/2 C Egg Beaters in place of the 2 eggs.1/4 C ""I can't believe it's not Butter"" in place of Butter.And not that it would make a difference but I baked it in a stoneware loaf pan and it came out beautiful.Very Good!",positive

It is a good recipe...but I believe that it would be better if it had raisins included,neutral
"I have made this pie instead of plain ol' pumpkin pie for the last 7 years.Everyone always raves about it.The flavor is wonderful and the texture is slightly lighter than traditional pumpin pie, I suspect due to the substitution of light cream instead of canned milk.If you try this, you won't go back to plain ol' pumkin again!",positive
Careful not to cook it too long... you want the tuna to be closer to raw on the inside and crusty on the outside. Maybe use canola oil instead of butter to help sear the outside.,neutral
"Working 12 hour days 7 days a week, I was delighted to return home to a delious meal from my Crockpot.Easy,tasty, and delious are understatements for this recipe!",positive
I think this recipie is awesome. It tastes delicious and my whole family loved it.,positive

This is a great dish. I like to make it. It's not fat and very healthy. Lots of iron because of the spinach. The recipe is also known as Palak Gosht. Love it.Helen v.d. Sluijs - Holland,positive
"It's easy and full of flavor.Serve with egg noodles.One note, if cooking with wine, never use ""cooking wine"".If you can't drink it, it isn't worth putting in your food!!!Add 1/4 - 1/2 cup sour cream right before serving for a creamier and richer sauce.",neutral

Not much Effort.,negative
This is the best pie crust I have ever made.It is simple and easy.I have tried to make it fail but can not.The taste and texture is wonderful.,positive
"Our family has enjoyed this recipe, time and time again with great success. Favorite topping for this is to serve with chili, grated cheese and onions. The kids love it simply with catsup.

"I just had to make this magic food of song (at least as sung by Sharen, Lois and Bram).I must say that I usually don'tlike walnuts, but they were great in this.This was very tasty, though not as rich as I might have guessed.It was somewhatsweeter than I normally like, but I did not leave any in the bowl. The upside down presentation is showy.I recommend some very rich ice cream as a topping or side dish (Blue Bell Homemade VanillaIce Cream fills the bill in my neck of the woods).Fun and tasty.The pan size that worked for me was 9"" by 9"". The recipe did not specify",neutral
"Thanks for giving recipes for such good food.You saved my thanksgiving.My sister-in-laws and I are cooking dinner this year for thanksgiving.All of the older ladies have all died so it is up to us to get everyones belly full.Cooking for a big family requires lots of food.Good food.I am a good cook but some of the things I was asked to cook I have never cooked before.I needed help!!!And thanks to this wonderful site on my computer I got all the help I needed.I used many recipes and am very pleased with the outcome.The lightened green bean casserole was my favorite.All the other recipes I found other places where all very common.I suggest to everyone, if you have not tried this you really need to.It is very delicious.And also very good for you.Thanks again for my wonderful thanksgiving dinner.Your devoted cook,lynn",positive

I recently tried this recipe and got rave reviews from family and friends!,positive
"I came upon this recipe while searching for a sweet potato topping. I didn't like the recipe for the potato itself because it would have been much to sweet and ""heavy"" for my tastes. I did enjoy the topping very much, though. I topped plain, buttered sweet potatoes with it and they were quite good.",neutral

"The French Onion soup recipe is one of the most popular dish served at the Famous Barr (also part of the May Dept store group) restaurants found in St.Louis. Based on my travels to the various countries including Europe, Asia and US, this version of French Onion soup is one of the best I've had. My husband who is from London just loves this recipe.It is robust and hearty in beef and onion flavour and quite thick so you can enjoy this as a meal in itself (you might say it's great comfort food).Be sure to use the broiler until the cheese bubbles and turns golden brown over the French bread. Tip: Try to use the fresh French bread which is a bit chewy in texture.Bon Appetit.",positive
My grandma has been making this simple coffee cake for years.It is a huge favorite for the whole family!We add chopped pecans to ours.Really easy for overnight company.It rises overnight and you pop it in the oven before everyone gets up.,positive

"I am always looking for things such as this to give as gift to friends and family. I make an instant spice tea, which was given to me by a very good friend years ago. It has instant tea, cinnimon, tang, instant lemonade, cloves, etc. It is like the mocha cocoa mix. My friends will enjoy this at Christmas. I will be putting it in small mason jars with a material cap tied off with ribbon and a small Christmas wooden ornement.Thank you this will be great,Grannymj0",positive

"Excellent chili, especially liked it with the spaghetti.I prefer more chili powder than the recipe called for.Also makes for very good chili cheese fries.",positive
"Flavorless and bad.I fortunately, saved it by looking at another recipe for Caldillo on this site and and adding some of the ingredients listed there.",negative
I love this recipe!! I use chopped peacons for the nuts. This recipe is absolutely a must try!!These cookies homemade are much better than the store brand.,positive

I heard about this fudge this morning..looked up the recipe and made it..it is great..so easy and the best fudge I've ever eaten.,positive
"I loved this recipe, very tasty and makes a great appy, i will be making it for my new years party.",positive
This was easy to make and handy to have in the freezer ready to just bake. I will have to learn to cut it down into four serving sizes though. It was to much just for my husband and I. I also added ground beef to mine. It tasted really good.,positive
"BOY!You sure can't eat just one of these muffins at a time. They were really great and easy to make. I even made a terrible mistake, I forgot to put the brown sugar in. The next two batches I make I will do right. I didn't think something with green chili in would taste good. Was I surprised.",positive
"I have made this recipe for the last 6-7yrs. at Christmas.I usually don't like fudge, but this is GREAT.I give it as gifts and everyone always asks for the recipe.",positive
"Best Chilli I have ever had.Nice and spicey, filling and again, the best chilli I have ever had.",positive
This is a great recipe... make ahead and broil before serving. My friends love this.,positive
I made a double batch of this soup and added a medium onion and two cloves of garlic. It was easy and I thought it was really great. Of coarse potato soup is my favorite and this was the best that I have ever made. I am going to put in individual servings and freeze.,positive
"I've often made these with different liquers. Orange, raspberry and peach are favorites.Of course, when my husband makes them, with either rum or bourbon, they're a bit more ""liquidy"" than normal.",positive
I love this soup it was great.i would love to try to make it again some time to have.I did tell all my friends about it and they loved it too.ao to eveyone this is the best soup try it too.,positive
This recipe is so versatile!I've made it minty with flavoring. I've used nuts and marshmellows for a rocky road fudge.,positive
"3 medium onions made a very tasty part of a meal for 3 persons. The recipe ingredients reads ""20 butter"" and ""onions"" but doesn't sayhow many.I used about a 1/2 C. butter and 3 medium onions and it worked out fine and the cooking time seemed to be the right time.3 med. onions would serve 4 people. They would be really yummy atop a thick juicy filet mignon! In fact, I believe that this recipe could be included with a large number of meals of various types.",positive
"The soup was easy to make and delicious. I agree with the chef, that it isn't just glorified chicken broth! The recipe says it makes 4 servings, but I'd say it was closer to 6, the servings were ample. The measurements for ounces I adapted as follows: 3/4 C diced carrots, 3/4 C diced celery and 2 medium size onions, chopped. The ingredients didn't list the corn tortillas, just the chips. I added about 10 diced corn tortillas to boil into the soup and the consistency turned out great.",positive
"This is the best eggnog I have ever had.It's good with fat-free half and half, too.The writer suggested Jack Daniels might be good in it, but it is especially good with 1/2 cup of light rum (preferably Bacardi) and 1/2 cup of Crown Royal.Delicious!",positive
"This recipe was great! In order to make the recipe even easier, I substituted the sweet potatoes with canned sweet potatoes -- and it STILL came out good. The entire family loved it, including the kids, and my sister and mother-in-law asked for the ""secret"" recipe.",positive
Absolutely Delightful Recipe! Rich and Flavorful!,positive

My daughter and I made this bread over Christmas and it was wonderful.We left out the fruit--the bread lasted almost one day--the aroma was awesome!!!

"While on my first visit to Ireland in July 1999, the birthplace of parents, my cousin and I stopped in Doolen near the Cliffs of Mohr and had this marvelous dark Irish Beef Stew cooked in Guinness Stout""at O'Connors Pub.It was absolutely delicous and the first authentic Irish meal we had and while all the food was great there was nothing that could beat the Irish Stew.When I found the recipe on this site, I immediately tried it and it is exactly like what we had in Ireland.When my cousin came to dinner and I served it, he was sure I had gotten the recipe from O'Connors Pub while we were in Ireland.It was a cinch to make, directions were very easy to follow and it practically cooks itself.It is equally as good over mashed potatoes or rice.Try it, you'll like it. The one ingredient I added was a ""wee bit of blarney""",positive
"What a joy finding this recipe. I didn't want just another cranberry recipe.I rate this recipe a solid 5 because:Ease of finding the products to make it, minimal preparation time and the final results of all who enjoyed it : )I utilized fresh cranberries, red seedless grapes, and braeburn apples with fresh made whipped cream (i chopped fresh pecans on the side for those who would like to add some to their serving).This dish was smashing with prime rib.Joyeux Noel.....Sandra",positive

I doubled this recipe for Christmas dinner 2000 and everyone came back for 2nd's and some even for 3rd's. Very easy to make.I increased the cooking time to 60 min's and put a extra cheese on top for the last 15 min. uncovered for a nice crust of baked cheese.,positive

"Aren't there 6 or seven stars to choose from.WOW!I was so excited to see this recipe.I absolutely loved this soup when my husband and I would go to Famous Barr 30 years, when he was in the seminary at Concordia St. Louis.I have made it through the years, because an aunt had sent me the recipe from her local Springfield, IL newspaper about 20 years.Once I lost it, but a friend retrieved it for me from the time she had asked me for it.What I love about your site is the instant way to double or triple or whatever the recipe!I make this recipe a number of times each year, but I always make it for a big Christmas Party we have.Everyone loves it and looks forward to it each year!Thanks so much!I always serve it with homemade bread and a Ceasar Salad.I look forward to your newsletters.",positive

Anyone can post a recipe on Recipezaar, so even the bizarre will show up some times.Wonder when someone will post the ""Recipe for Disaster""? ;-)I hope everyone can see the humor in this recipe.",negative
"Great recipe!Several changes might help thicken the soup a bit.I used half and half instead of plain milk.Also, 1 tsp. corn starch mixed with hot water helped to thicken. I added some small cubes of potato and some celery. This makes the soup complete.",positive

Great recipe for anyone who like it as close as it come to the real thing! Very simple to make and you can find all the ingredents in your local supermarket! I myself would cut back on the white pepper and add a little bit of hot oil (not to much)! I would also add about 1 1/2 tbls more of vineger. (or to taste) add a little more meat and you can serve with a bowl of white rice with steamed veggies for a meal of its own.,positive
"My husband and I simply loved this soup. I added half a medium onion to mine, and put in four cloves of garlic instead of two. We sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese on ours before enjoying.",positive
This recipe was simple to make and easy to convert to serve more people.I like the fact that the ingredients are those usually found in someones pantry and that preparation time was 10 minutes or less to combine and could be left alone in the oven to cook.Wish all recipes were this easy and delicious.I will definetly add this to my keeper list.,positive

"Be aware that this is the EXACT recipe that is printed in the booklet that comes with a new crockpot.It's easy enough, but they call for too much flour, it's a little pasty-tasting to me.Luckily, I made a test batch before I cooked for guests or I would have been embarrassed.Cut the flour amount down to about 1/2 and add more pepper.I've found that browning the beef first seals it and makes it taste better.",neutral

"I haven''t tasted it yet because I''m just trying it for the first time for a family member''s birthday party. I am boiling the pineapple and sugar at the moment and tomorrow, I will put the pudding/cream cheese mixture on it and add the bananas and whipped topping and coconut and cherries. It sounds just marvelous! I intend to put a red transparent g-string on the finished product as it seems quite appropriate! I''m sure it''s going to taste fabulous so I will give it the highest rating! Mahalo for the great recipe and looking forward to more... Aloha, Ijeva-----I finally baked the cake and changed it to chocolate instead of yellow cake mix.It is absolutely delicious.I would however, not put 2 cups of sugar because it is awfully sweet but might reduce the quantity or even substitute with some kahlua and milk instead.Other than that, my son devoured the rest of the cake.Superb!",positive

"My comments are for those who just read the review by the previous reviewer, Bill de Bruler who commented on the fact that 1/4 cup of hot pepper flakes was too much for this recipe. I'd have to agree but also point out that the recipe called for 1/4 teaspoon, rather than 1/4 cup. This might explain why he thought it was a tad toasty.

"This recipe has been used in our family for many years.My problem now is that I have trouble finding green tomatoes!The recipe is very simple, but I salt and pepper the tomatoes a little and add a little white flour to the cornmeal.My mother would sprinkle a little sugar - white or brown - on the tomato after she turned them.When the sugar melts and is crusty the tomato is done.",positive

"I doubled this recipe which made the whipping time a little longer but it took me approximately one hour from starting the crust to refrigerating the cheesecake.It is delicious and worth the effort even though I didn't feel it was a recipe meant for a beginner.I also substituted the bourbon for Irish Mist Liqeur (Yummy) and melted some white chocolate, tinted green, and poured it over the top of the cheesecake using a cut-out shaped like a shamrock.Nice St Patrick's Day treat.Without the topping, nice anytime.Great recipe.",positive
"First of all I omited the coffee because we don't drink it and never have it on hand. I prepared the dough in my bread machine and divided it among four lightly greased mini loaf pans. It rose uncovered in my oven on the warm setting for 30 minutes. I turned the heat up to 350 F and set the timer for 30 minutes, then forgot about it until the timer rang. I turned it out onto a wire rack and brushed the tops with real butter. WOW! Great bread! Aromatic, flavorful, full bodied, small crumb texture...firm, yet lighter than expected. I can't wait to make this for my German mother-in-law who is a bread snob of the worst kind, as most European's are (and for good reason). I've taken a picture to share. You'll know it's mine by my Blue Willow China in the background and the cranberry garnish. This bread recipe will go into the official family cookbook for sure. After my little photo shoot I enjoyed a couple slices with a cream cheese but my boys, 3 and 4 yrs old finished off one of the loaves plain. Tonight we're having leftover Roast Sticky Chicken, fresh fruit and herb tea for dinner. This bread with butter, slices of honey cured ham, and good havarti cheese will be a perfect compliment. Thanks! :o)",positive

"Haven't tried it yet , but it has to be great!",positive
"Very good recipe, especially for anyone on a low carbohydrate diet. This was pizza with out the crust. I added a step of draining the grease off after 20 min of cooking, and before putting back in the oven I added a layer of pepperoni on top, cooked another 5 min or until pepperoni's started to get crispy, and then added the cheese. Very easy preparation.",positive

"I am new at trying tofu, but this one was quite nice. I would suggest finding some sort of marinade for the tofu before coating it though. Something light, that won't compete with the delicious ginger sauce. Even if you aren't a tofu fan, definately write down the ginger sauce recipe. YUM.Next time, I may try freezing the tofu first too. That is supposed to give the tofu a ""meatier"" texture. Just drain, unwrap, rewrap in plastic very tightly, and freeze. I don't think you are supposed to thaw it completely before use though.",neutral
"I found I didn't have any cream of chicken or mushroom to make the traditional Hash Brown Casserole, so I found this recipe.I substituted 1/2 1% milk and 1/2 Half and Half for the milk, used low-fat instead of non-fat sour cream and added 1/2 cup chopped green pepper instead of 1/2 cup chopped onions.Regular cheddar as well.Very yummy...but a more fat than recipe...",positive

"As a German National, growing up in the birthplace of Spaetzle in the Swabian community, having had Spaetzle twice a week since I can remember, I have to tell you that Spaetzle are not made with milk. You just use water. In the old days Spaetzles dough was made thinner and put on a cuttingboard then scraped into boiling water. It only takes a couple of minutes..less then 5, for Spaetzle to be done. I actually have a spaetzlesmachine where you fill in the dough and it comes out looking like spagetti, but you stir them up and they break a little, cookingtime is 2 minutes...once they boil take them out. Spaetzlesmachine is much like a potatoricer, there are places on the web where you can buy those. Thats authentic Spaetzle. Sometimes my Mom just made Spaetzle, browned some onions in butter and put them over the spaetzle, serve with a fresh green salad and you got a complete meal.",negative

"I didn't try the recipe...there seemed to be something missing from the recipe my mother gave me.This recipe is from Epe in Gelderland in Holland.To 2 litres of boiling beef stock (16 cups)add 500g (1lb) of minced lamb fry (liver) and 500g (1lb) minced beef. When boiling, add salt 'til it's too salty (approx 15 teaspoons).In addition, add AllSpice (Pimento) 'til it's too spicy (approx 5 teaspoons).Boil rapidly until meats are cooked.Take the pot off heat, then add (quickly) approx. 2lb (1kilo) white flour stirring continuously until it's a 'lump' which you can't stir anymore (you may need help with this as the arms go into heavy duty mode).Try to ensure that the flour is evently stirred with no lumps.Spoon into (floured)containers and leave to chill.Turn out from container once chilled and cut into 1cm slices, then fry in extremely hot pan with preferred oil, butter or fat until dark brown and crispy.(Good idea to fry outside as can leave 'blue' smoke throughout house)A great winter meal or snack...always wanting one more slice!",negative

"Alright - I'm notoriously a bad cook.My previous menu mostly included cereal with milk and take-out.Call me crazy, but I got ambitious a little bit ago, and decided I was going to cook up a meal for a date.It must have been divine intervention, because for some reason I actually chose this intimidating recipe.Well - hallelujah! Amazingly it turned out fantastic!I even impressed my gourmet chef boss with the left-overs.I am very impressed with this one.Thanks!I'm serving it tonite for a dinner date - also including rice and maybe some bread - most likely bisquits and honey (ok - so I'm no gourmet).I think this also goes well with a semi-dry white wine.",positive

"This has to be one of my favourite pasta recipes, simply because it's very simple, non-greasy, light, and absolutely yummy! I had to substitue the parmesan cheese with mozarella, but that didn't make much of a difference. One good variation is to substitute capsicum for olives. Use 1 capsicum for every 4 olives, and chop them finely. You might have to saute the tomato-capsicum mixutre a little while longer for the capsicum to cook, or you can saute it just enough for the nice crunchy feel ",positive

"Our family has enjoyed a couple of variations of this delicious summer appitizer. It can be made with refrigerated Pillsbury French Bread Dough, baked according to directions, cooled completely,and sliced into 1/4 inch pieces. We have used dried dill weed to sprinkle on top instead of the paprika. I prefer the spread to be not so firm, so I add 2T of mayonnaise to the mixture. This makes it more like a dip consistency, but it is easier to spread over soft bread.",positive

I have made this recipe many times to get rave reviews and licked the platter clean!The only alteration I make is I slow-cook the ribs at 325 degrees for about 3 hrs.This seems to allow the flavors more time to permeate the meat plus makes for ribs which melt in your mouth.,positive

This is made better by making a fast tempura and deep frying.The canned biscuits make this taste too much like...well...biscuits with apples in them.This would peobably also be better with a caramel glaze over it and make it like a small pie instead.The biscuits need to be VERY flat though...,neutral

"This was an excellent recipe!The caramel did come out darker than I thought it would, but then I've never done this before.I also cooked it in the oven for only 39 minutes.If I had left it longer it would have burned.Ovens do vary and the one hour time is approximate.I think next time I may add cinnamon to the caramel or sprinkle it on top after cooking.I took it to the ER where my mom works and the nurses LOVED it!I will definitely make this again.",positive

"This recipe was fantastic! I had to adapt it to make it wheat and sugar free (using maple syrup and honey) for my daughter and it worked really well. It was easy to make, easy ingredients and cooked quickly. For a movie pig-out I left some of the batter over and put it in the middle of two cookies. Also makes a great icing.",positive
"This sauce is so yummy, and the aroma is wonderful. I cooked 3 rump steaks instead, and doubled the sauce mixture, using small, frequent amounts to fry the steak in (and to put on top of the steak as a quick marinade), then using the bit left over to spoon over the steak and fried rice I made. I also used soy margarine instead of butter, dijon mustard and 1 freshly squeezed orange, because I ran out of lemons.",positive
Great recipe!!Similar to Finnish Mustikkapannukakku (Blueberry pancakes) with the inclusion of baking powder and sour cream (I like my pancakes thin so I exclude the powder and thin the mixture with 1 more egg and cup of milk but love the addition of sour cream!!).I cook these on medium-high heat with butter (Don't use non-stick griddles as the high heat will trash the pan rather quickly).,positive

My Mother used to make tomato preserves from a recipe she got from her Mother. I have used their recipe successfully. The quantities were the same but it did not require pectin. They also added a broken cinnamon stick. I always found this delightful.

"Aha!Someone stole my recipe!I've been using something close (the recipe, not the method) to this for some time now and it is my favorite.A couple of twists on the theme...1.I use a packet of powdered chicken bouillon in my flour mix for more savory taste....especially if you are using the frozen chicken parts.2.For one flavor variation of mine, I add about a tsp or less of curry powder to the flour mix...not enough for an East Indian taste, but as a nice spice.3.Another flavor is to crush just a small amount (a big pinch) of anis (anisette) in a mortarandpestle and add that to the flour.This flavor is very popular here in the Caribbean...in fact I think this is one of the secrets of KFCs recipe.Sounds weird, but try it!4.And, of course, MORE salt and black pepper!-BillVieques, PR",positive

"A very big hit in my house where my children are very finicky eaters!

"I find the easiest way to pre-cook and soften the cabbage leaves is to core the cabbage, then place the entire head in a covered stock pot of boiling water.After about 4 minutes, carefully lift the head of cabbage out of the pot using 2 large cooking spoons; place on a dinner plate and remove the soft outer leaves.Again place the remaining head of cabbage back into the boiling water and repeat the process until all the leaves are softened and have been removed.I bake the cabbage rolls in a 325 degree oven for approximately 2 hours.This slower cooking permits the flavors to mature and also ensures tender cabbage leaves.",positive

"This is a very interesting dish as it is,with a refreshing taste, but it can also provide the creative cook with a base that can be used to add more flavors. I plan to add basil next time.",positive

"This salsa is so fresh tasting and fantastic, anyone who has tried it loves it!!!",positive
"This definately feeds more than six.It was very easy to make, the taste was okay, filling, you can easily add any other ingredients you like.So overall it's a good recipe, you just need to add more ingredients to add more flavor.",neutral
"I made this, and much to my amazement, didn't blow my kitchen up, light anything on fire, or injure any small animals in the process.I'm the most non-domestic person, and I was so pleased with how easy this was! It turned out beautifully, and the pennies work great! Can't wait to try the pear butter next. :D",positive
I made these ribs for some friends. I chose the slow-cook way and then grilled them slightly. They turned out great. I got rave reviews.,positive
These are wonderful - perfect for a sweet snack or for breakfast!,positive
"I omitted all the ingredients before the ground meat because I was already putting these in my spaghetti sauce, and I used ground turkey.I still thought the meatballs were great. The recipe was easy, and baking was a nice cooking method -- simple and better for the low fat turkey.Not sure if I'll ""die for them"" but liked them plenty. ;-)",positive
"Really tastey and filling.I made this in two stages. First I made the meat mixture the night before and the corn meal topping the night I served it, then I put it together and put it in the oven.I used chiles too and replaced 1/2 lb of beef with kidney beans.I also saved the corn for the topping (I did drain it).I like highly seasoned food and felt this was seasoned perfectly.",positive
This is the shrimp cocktail recipe I have been searching for. Thanks. It made a wonderful appetizer.,positive
"This soup tastes great. I omitted the chicken boullian and the cheese, because I wanted just a basic potato soup, like my Mema used to make. I had a pretty hard time getting the lumps out of the flour/butter mixture. I kinda had to smush the with my sppon as I was mixing. If anyone has a better was of doing this, please let me know. Also, this soup would be great topped with bacon bits. Jessica, Texas",positive

Lovely and Moist.,positive
"I've been looking for along time for pancakes just like ""My Old Gran ""use to make and this is it.",positive
These are very good I make them all the time but instead of seasoned salt I use regular salt and then use Mrs Dash extra spicy or Tony Chachere's more spice (about a tbsp and a bit),positive
"I liked the recipe but it was rather bland. I expected more flavor with all the spices that were used. It was easy to make, the rice was very good, I would probably use four red chillies the next time.I was unsure as to how much cilantro to add and when to add it.",neutral
Pesto only really works with pine kernals (or as a last resort - walnuts) and you really need much more basil to get the true flavour,negative

This recipe was absolutely fantastic.I had never had anything quite like this before and it was delicious.This is a great dish for something to eat on the go or you can forgo the chicken and leave it as a vegetarian dish.It was excellent I highly recomend it.,positive
Awesome!!!This is one f the best smooth salsa's I've ever had!,positive
"This was VERY good, and easy.My favorite combination.There were no leftovers at our house either.I added a little minced garlic and I cooked the chicken in a baking dish in half a can of chicken broth, I didn't add the other ingredients until the chicken had cooked a little, then added the cheese, and diluted the soup with the other half can of broth.I also instead of ""topping"" the chicken with the stuffing mix, put it between and all around the chicken.That way, you could see the chicken, and the stuffing.",positive
This was quite easy to make and got rave reviews from my family.I will certainly keep this as a favorite.,positive
We weren't crazy about this dish.Would be good for kids.I did like the bacon and it stayed crisp.,neutral
We served this punch at our wedding and it was a complete hit!I've since passed it on to 3 more brides!,positive

We're very pleased!Tastes just like the Zuppa we get at Olive Garden.Thanks!Larry Souders,positive
Lovely salad.,positive
"Excellent recipe! Definitely restaurant quality. I substitued the carrots and snowpeas with a 16oz bag of oriental mix frozen vegetables. I think the cashews are a nice touch, but not necessary as it is the sauce that makes this dish. The ginger gives this dish a wonderful flavor.",positive
Sounds great.I'd add some diced celery.,positive

Hey everyone.Im a young man from New Zealand and have been brought up on Lolly Cake. My advice is try it. Its so nice and so simple to make. Peace be with you all.,positive
"Oh yea, this is yummy!",positive
"This is a good basic receipe, but the bake time is really far out.My oven is tested to correct thermometer heat.The oven was preheated to 350 degrees and this ""cake"" was done after 45 minutes and brown too!!1 1/4 hrs plus 10 minutes is 40 minutes too long!! Had I not been watching it, it would have been a disaster!! Having ignorned your time instructions, it actually turned out quite nice, but more like a pie than a cake. Will try it with peaches next time.",neutral
"This was quick, easy and super good!Plus I liked the carbohydrate count, LOW!Great for us Carbohydrate Addicts!I forgot to add the chili's and it was still great.",positive
"This recipe was seriously lacking something.The ingredients were good, but the chili had no zip!There was no bite whatsoever to it, just a bunch of different flavorings roaming around in the pot!I didn't even realize I was eating chili until my husband asked me what it was!What I did was I added some other ingredients to this sauce and saved the pot!I was determined not to throw out my meat and ingredients!Sorry--- but thank you.",negative
"This pie is utterly scrumptious! It's basically a chess pie chockful of good things, very rich and toothsome. A lot like a pecan pie. This same recipe has been in my family for years, and we make this pie every holiday. I grew up in the South, where this pie is an old classic and is called ""Japanese"" simply because in the old days the coconut was considered rather exotic (in the same vein as what Southerners called ""Japanese fruitcakes,"" which contained tropical fruits). If you haven't tried this pie, please do! I bet you'll find a new family favorite!",positive
Just like my Granny use to make but she.d swop raisins for currants occasionally.,positive
Really nice.I like the idea of using almonds instead of the more usual pinenuts in this pesto.,positive
This is great. My family are not fond of green peppers so I diced up some baby carrots instead and put them into my rice as I turned off the heat. When all was added to my wok w/chicken...my kids ate it up for lunch today.Walt you have no clue to whats good.,positive
"Having always loved fried okra, I never thought about using anything but cornmeal. The combination of flour and cornmeal, as well as the idea of using just flour, was a new idea to me. Thanks, Mark",positive
I really liked this soup. I ate four bowls of it!,positive
OUTSTANDING!... and I tried it without the pinenuts because we are on a low carb diet.My family didn't think they liked brussel sprouts untill they tried this! Easy too...,positive
yum I think is tastes so nice where did you get the recipe from ? or who did you get it from? it was very easy to make and it handled well. what sort wine do you suggest for it like with after noon tea.,positive
Yum cool tastes just right,positive
Just plain yum,positive
"Did it again Bergy!!I microwaved the spuds, cooked the onions, put it together in the am and cooked it later that night.The onion and potato each had their flavours come through distinctly.Good veggie dish.",positive
"I made this pie two different times. The first time, I followed the directions exactly. It didn't set up very well, and didn't make a very nice presentation. When I made it a second time, while the pudding was still hot I added chocolate chips. I stirred until melted. The pie turned out awesome. This is a very easy to follow recipe. My family enjoyed this.",positive
Sorry it went a little sloopy but the kids liked it.,neutral
"This is very good.Especially easy too for those who are fairly new to cooking. At first, I was skeptical about the ramen noodles.",positive
this recipe was great and i am going to cook for my gcse coursework as it sounds so easy and fun to make i will let you know how it went on thanks for this truly great idea!!!!!!!!!!,positive
"I wasn't at all concerned about the ingredients.I have used Wishbone Italian forever, mixed with worchestershire to marinate steaks in.I never even thought of using for a roast.Yes, the gravey is FANTASTIC!!!Very Good!!!",positive
easy tro fix and great way to get the kids to try sauerbraten for the first time.,positive
"Very *moreish*my daughter loved them,the sesame seeds give a nice flavour and crunch",positive
"Easy and yummy.Didn't have ground beef, so used a little cut up cooked pork, but concluded they would have been just as good without.Did end up putting some sesame oil, soy sauce and ground ginger in the mix for more flavor.Who would have thought that making your own egg rolls could be so easy.",positive
Excellent!!I served this at a bridal shower and everyone loved it.It is also so quick and easy to make!,positive
"Lox and Bagels, scrampled eggs with lox, or simply serve on dark bread or crackers sprinked with fresh lime makes a simple but very cool appetizer or before dinner coocktail. I live in Michigan, USA and a buddy of mine pulled about 9 huge Salmon out of a small stream in Traverse City I had to take advantage of such a great oppourtunity for fresh salmon, and free,this recipe takes some time and patient,but actually onlya little work. Try IT with cream cheese/eggs , or saute 3 onions inbutter and olive oil, seson salt and pepper, beat up 12 eggsadd to oven proof pan, 350 F oven until almost set and add chopped lox about 3/4 c to eggs and onion makes a great breakfast or dinner time meal serve with fresh bagels and 8 oz. slab cream cheese. Chef Brian 23 years cooking experience gratuate of Johnson and Wales Culinary 1987 Providence Rhode Island",positive
Everyone in my family and a couple of my neighbors tried and loved this beef stew.I used dehydrated onion in place of the onion soup mix and soy sauce replaced the worchestershire.I have never liked V8 Juice until I tried this recipe.Just the right amount of veggie taste was added!!!I procrastinated too long in the day and resorted to cooking on the stovetop which was about an hour and a half of simmering to tenderness.,positive
"It was GREAT! I didn't have a sponge cake available, so used a plain cake mix and made one. In the cake, I did add 1 tspn of pineapple essence and half tspn of vanilla essence - these essences, especially the former, gave the cake a wonderful smell! Besides that, this recipe was really EXCELLENT! My parents loved it and so did I. A big ""THANK U"" to your mom from me and my family and ofcourse to U for sharing this",positive
"This is just what I was looking for! My family raved about the flavor and thought the vinegar was such a compliment to the chicken. I baked it in the oven on a cookie sheet as my grill was disabled, and it was great. I marinated the chicken pieces overnight. I sprinkled it with paprika for color. The cook said she preferred it with garlic which I included and I'm sure I will continue to use the garlic. I questioned the need for an egg, but used it exactly as the recipe called for. It was really wonderful and we will probably use this recipe often.",positive
This really was delicios and different.We had never eated rudabagas before and they definately added to the recipe.Thanks so much.I did have to increase the oven time to 25 minutes.,positive
These are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted! I will never make another recipe again.,positive
"You can also put it back in the icecream container and freeze it, than eat it with apple pie",positive
"This is an exceptional recipe for a canned salsa.My only change was to lessen the sugar.If your tomatoes are fairly sweet (home-grown, off the vine) you really don't need sugar.My family isn't in to HOT, but we didn't find this recipe hot at all - even when made exactly as given.Very mild, but with a little zip. ADDED NOTE:After I drained all the juices off the vegetables, I canned that separately as vegetable broth for soups later.it had a nice ""zippy"" flavor that will enhance winter soups.",positive
Awesome recipe for cinnamon buns...quick and easy,positive

This is good and beyond easy.I swirled some chocolate sauce over the top for decoration and another taste dimention.It was a little runny so next time I will put it in the freezer a half hour before serving.Excellent simple and good recipe.Thank you.,positive
I love garlic and ginger.It would probably have been good with just that.Even with low sodium soy it came out too salty for me.Next time I'll use either water or stock with a small amount of soy.,neutral
Very tasty -- it was a hit with young and old alike. Its also easy to prepare.,positive
"I made this a ""do ahead"" by boiling the onions in the morning and baking just before dinner.I also added and extra tbs or two of chile sauce after it had baked.This ""kicked it up a notch.""Thanks again Bergy.",positive
"Looks like a nice combination, but if I wanted to feed two people, I would double the amount of dried pasta. Once the salted water is boiling, the rotini should be about right in eight minutes, which should also be enough time to thaw the frozen vegetables under warm water ... I really dislike frozen peas in my salad :^)#. So by multi - tasking the meal should be done in under 15 minutes.",neutral
"Delicious and easy recipe. Instead of the hamburger, try some well-cooked sausage meat, drained. Add the cooked meat to the peppers and onions and proceed with the recipe.Serve with some grated cheddar or mozzarella cheese on the side to put on top. And a dollop of sour cream too, if desired.Serve with seasoned(olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika), oven-baked fried potatoes and a green salad.I used submarine buns and/or soft kaiser rolls.",positive

A lovely recipe any time of the year.Serve warm or cold.A great sidedish or maindish.Use your imagination to add some protein to the sald. Mmm...I think I could handle another helping!,positive
"Recipe was simple and quite delicious. The whole family loved it, well, except the four year old, but she doesn't like anything really. :: laugh :::I didn't have a lot of time to marinate the chicken, so I cut it into cubes to marinade and pan fried it. If you want to use the leftover marinade as a sauce, either use less soy, or put something else in it to take the saltiness out. The chicken was WONDERFUL, but the marinade a bit salty when used as a sauce. I still give this five stars because the marinade wasn't meant to be a sauce in the first place :: smile ::::",positive
"This was really very good.I liked the creamed corn.I added some red peppers as well, it was a pretty dish.",positive
This was great.Thanks for the tip about saving some for later.It made a lot of potatoes.I have them in the freezer to bake at a later time.,positive
What an awesome way to use up my zucchini (there always seems to be too much).This recipe surprised my friends and family who couldn't believe there was more zucchini than tomato in it.We found it was plenty hot with only 5 jalepenos.,positive
By far the best Salsa I have ever had! I even added some sliced black olives. Highly recommend this salsa! Canned great. Makes a wonderful gift too! They keep asking for more,positive
The title of this fondue is amusing.A lovely fondue with surprising flavours.The name of this fondue should be changed to The Great White North Fondue as its primary ingredient is Canadian sharp cheddar.Remember to use a Canadian beer in the recipe as well.Give yourself and your guests a treat.Then again I may be wrong in assuming the name of the fondue is not appropriate.A good disguise...cheers to the canucks!,positive

Great receipe! I added coconut flakes.,positive
Excellent,positive
"Thankyou Dorothy, I made this dish for brunch today and it looked great and tasted as good! I cut the recipe in half but left the Jalapeno and Garlic as called for. When I opened the fridge I saw ther were some bits and pieces of red, yellow and orange sweet peppers so added them as well. Excellent.I'll be repeating this dish.You can do ahead and just pop in the oven before brunch.",positive
"VERY GOOD !!!!I made it with Beef.I think it would be very good with chicken too with very little ""adjustment"".I'm going to try this with pork and with chicken (not at the same time though).",positive
This is very good and quick.Add a salad and you've got a nice little meal.,positive
This was Wonderful!!!!!!!!I will be making this again.Michelle B.,positive

This is very good.I would have never tried those spices with Brussel Sprouts.I'm going to try with other veggies.,positive
"I used light cream cheese, and light sour cream.I omitted the olive oil, and topped it with mozzerella.It made a great tasting, good consistency dip (which was fairly low-fat).",positive
Absolutely Delicious!I served them as a side dish with some grilled line fish.,positive
Really simple and quick to make. We enjoyed them.I will adapt to make them more like a hash brown and see how that works. Well done.,positive
I got compliments from the family on this one. It was easy and tasted great.,positive

This cookie is great! I haven't had the best history with no bake cookies. But this is the best recipe I have ever tried after looking long and hard for a good no bake cookies.,positive

"Easy to make, inexpensive, excellent flavor. The chorizo really adds to the dish, which tastes just like tamales.",positive
"I was apprehensive about trying these as I thought I'd be too used to deep-fried.These were great!Next time, I'm going to try adding a bit of cornmeal with the crumbs.",positive
"This is very good.Mom always used cream instead of the creamed corn.I use the cream corn.I think you get more of a ""Corn"" flavor.This is kinda related to my corn casserole.A distant cousin maybe but related.",positive
Extremely easy to make and takes almost no time. We should've made two; the first one didn't last long. Next time we will also try one with blueberry topping. Good recipe.,positive
"I likewise have tried several other recipes for salsa and this is definitely the best one. I made my first batch exactly as the recipe stated and then made just a few changes to the next batch, cutting back on the sugar and using only the small can of tomato paste and it turned out wonderful.I have several family and friends who love salsa and am planning on giving it as Christmas gifts this year.",positive
Lali this is indeed a winner.I cooked it Saturday night and I cut the recipe back to one serving it worked beautifully. Also I added more garlic (i'm a garlic freak) and it was just delicious. Thank-you Bergy,positive
"A straight 5 star recipe.I used skinless bonless and they turned out moist and very, very tasty. Nice combination of curry and mustard and Tebo, we sure agree on easy ""do it ahead"" recipes.I love to spend time with my guests and still turn out a tasty meal Thanks Bergy",positive
We sell this at our school as a fundraiser.We call it Bulldog chow.,positive
This was easy and my whole family enjoyed it.A nice twist using pineapples,positive
"This was really good. I doubled the recipe, and we had leftovers for the next day or two.I think that the next time I make it, however, I will use about half the sugar.Probably just use the brown sugar.It was a little too sweet for our tastes.Didn't go too well with bread for meatloaf sandwiches, when it was so sweet.The salt and everything else, is just the perfect amount for flavor.It tasted a lot like mine, except I use stewed tomatoes that have been pureed, instead of milk, and we have never done it with a sweet topping, just catsup alone.I have eaten the sweet kind, and have always liked it.But I will tone the sugar down a little next time.Great recipe!",positive
Very good and very easy.,positive
"Quick and easy to make, and everybody loved them! thanks for the recipe.",positive
"Wowthis was terrific.It really was moist and tender.I used a no fat mayo and this may be why it was so moist and tender.Served with a baked potato and Christine's baked onions (posted on this site) and a salad, it made a terrific meal.I will be doing this again.Thanks for the recipe",positive
Cooking onions brings out their sweetness.The bit of additional honey in this recipe put it over the edge.It is so simple and really tasty.I really like simple veggie dishes and this filled the bill.Glad you posted it Christine.Thanks,positive
I did not use the tomato paste.Just all the fresh stuff.This was very good that way too.,positive
"Very Good.I used fresh tomatoes though since I have so many.And fresh basil.Other than that, I followed this recipe.",positive
"This is the first time made and already is a favourite and will be repeated many times, with different types of cheese. Every one wants the recipe.I had no ""hot english mustard"" so I added dry mustard powder to the mayo with a teaspoon of hot creamed horseradish, tasting as I went, until I got the heat I wanted. Also did not have any almonds around, so I used walnuts. I cut the sugar to 2 teaspoons,(for the diabetic).Got rave reviews, Thank-you Bergy!!!Dorothy",positive
These make great gifts! I substitute bananas for the pumpkin and they turn out great! Also try zucchini or carrots.,positive
This is an excellent recipe but our tastes arefor a slightly hotter salsa.To the basic recipeI added 1 to 3 hot peppers (habeneros or chilipeppers) increased the cumin 1/2 to 1 teaspoon and added cilantro.,positive
I traditionally do not like chicken casserole dishes.This one was excellent.,positive
Awesome and super moist.,positive
I made these for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved them ;),positive
This was really easy to make and is great tasting. Will make again next year!,positive
It is a good and quick recipe,positive
"Wow!! I have tried to make white gravy a few times, but could never get it right. Now, I finally did!! Thankyou so much! ",positive
"Very good recipe, and easy too. I did omit the extra water that was called for and still had MORE than enough liquid to make the sauce.Next time I think I will reduce the sauce by half before adding the rest of the ingredients.",positive
"This is the best.I've made two batches and used Cherry Tomatoes from my garden.For the second batch, I added one extra teaspoon of Cumin and a little more hot peppers to make it hotter, more like a Medium hot.I also froze the salsa instead of canning it and used the Gladware containers.I had read a warning from the Cooperative Extension not to can salsa because the vegetables in it make it unsafe to can.I will make this salsa for years to come.",positive
"This is a wonderful recipe.Easy to do, quick (if you use the oven method)and flavorful.Can be adapted to things on hand.A layer or two of sliced onions changes the taste.Guests have requested this dish when they know I am cooking.A keeper!",positive
"I think this recipe works better with prawn,prawn and pork, or just pork.Dipping sauce is definitely necessary, a vietnamese style peanut dipping sauce is best.",neutral
lovely.great color and crust on the chicken.i threw a little of the spice mix in my couscous and shallots too. and served with acorn squash roasted with maple syrup.,positive
This is a classic.,positive
"I really liked this. The simple yet rich taste of olive oil and garlic are two of my favorites. The breadcrumbs added a nice texture to the dish.I keep thinking about this recipe. Maybe I'm wierd. This recipe is different from the ordinary pasta recipe, but it is just wonderful. I put lots of garlic in it and I added extra olive oil. Next time I make it I will probably cut the bread crumbs down to 3/4 cup. But I just have to reiterate, this dish stays on your mind. Good Job Paula",positive
Found that the 2 hour marinade was too long - it started to cook the shrimp.I only let it go 1 hour. Best grilled shrimp recipe so far.,positive
"I expanded the recipe a little to feed a larger group and put sauteed chicken breast as the bottom layer. It could have used a tiny bit of chicken stock in the expanded recipe, but was an absolute success. Very well recived - thank you!",positive
Just finished licking my fingers - Oh so good.,positive
really easy to make,neutral
A lot like the ham and cabbage stew that's been passed down in my Irish family for generations. Only we don't use the herbs...just lots of salt and pepper. Definitely a good use for leftover Easter ham.,neutral

"I did not like this at all,I had freinds over so I made somthing easy,no one cared for them.",negative
Really very easy and quick to do.It is a little too bland for me.Maybe some nuts or seeds or chocolate would pick it up.Still worth having in the cookbook.,neutral

"this is a really good recipe,i have even made beef stew with it i just add 2 beef bouilon and 2 cups of water andstew beef cook in slow cooker very good recipe you have there",positive
"Thanks Tebo This is the same recipe that I lost (can''t find). I agree it is very good. Guess I''ll just have to do it again twist, twist, Cheers Bergy(I forgot to add that I cut the sugar back to 2 cups, not quite as sweet)",positive
"Thank you.This recipe was terrific.I made it for my mother in law's birthday dinner and everyone seemed to like it.I followed the direction of the other review and also added chicken broth and a small amount of minced garlic. My Mother in law asked that I make it for any future family parties. Big hit, no leftovers!",positive
"This is good !! Love Alfredo but it is usually so heavy in calories. I put it over linguine and added some chopped black olives on top, also sprinkled some more parmesan on top. Used 2% milk, didn't have 1%. A very good supper,thank-you Jellybean, it will be a repeat!!Dorothy",positive
"I substituted nutritional yeast for the milk powder to veganize this, and black instead of green olives, and it turned out absolutely fantastic.",positive
Interesting recipe.I followed it to the letter.The roast I had was small (About 2 lbs) and I though it came out too well done.It had the texture of a crock pot roast rather than a rare cooked roast.Will try it again with a larger and less expensive cut of meat.Hope you post more recipies.,neutral
What a great recipe!!I love different ways to serve vegetables.I used linguine in this and it worked fine.I also cut the broccoli cooking time in half as I like broccoli really crunchy.Terrific!!,positive
Very simple to make and tastes great!,positive
I changed the recipe and used 2 biscuits for1 sandwich. I had a top and a bottom.Easier toseal and you could fill it a little more.I thenended up with 4 sandwichs. They were very goodand will have them again. They would be greatto have ready when friends come over.,positive
Agree with Bill.This was good and easy to do.I doubled the recipe and it went over very well.Glad you shared this with us.,positive
"One of the best dips ever, also good used as a spread for party sandwiches.",positive
this was so good it is like you were eating in a diner very very good,positive
"Good! Easy to make, and it had a nice minty taste!",positive
This one is great to take to the office when having a breakfast.,positive
I love apple crisp! I have made it for at home and to take to get togethers. Most everyone likes it and it is easy to make. I use both brown sugar and granulated sugar.And I will try the nutmeg.Other than those two differences our recipes are the same.,positive
"My husband loved it, thanks!!",positive
"Great easy, tasty recipeI boiled the sausage first and pricked them (this gets rid of all the fat), threw in some mushrooms, sweet and hot pepper as well as the onion.Used Peri Peri sauce instead of tabasco.Thanks Elizabeth, cheers Bergy",positive
"This makes a filling, hearty soup that is definitely a meal in itself.Wonderful recipe.Adding bacon compliments it well.",positive
We loved this recipe.We made this with another recipe called Azteca Soup from Recipezaar. A very nice flavorful dish to go with soups.,positive
"We loved this recipe.The result is a juicy, tasty chicken.Thanks for sharing. I basted with chicken broth the first few times, until enough drippings were available for basting.",positive
first of all wild boar is not that hard to get.if you remove the bone it dries out a lot more and the bone gives it more flaveo,neutral
It was very easy and we loved it.,positive
"I have always loved stuffed mushrooms, but afraid to try to make them myself.This recipe was tasty and easy.Looks and tastes like a lot of work, but it's not!",positive
"I licked the bowl,the beaters, and the spoons. It was amazing that I had enough cream cheese filling for the actual recipe! I loved this recipe.The phyllo dough made an elegant cup for the cream cheese filling and cherry pie filling.I loved the hint of lemon in the cream cheese layer.",positive
"This was surprisingly elegant for such a simple recipe.I was a bit worried about the vegetables getting dried out during cooking so I covered the pan during the first half hour.The potatoes turned out just right - moist, tender and just a bit browned.",positive
a very nice easy recipe.a recipe that has the right ingredents,positive
This is one of my favorite cookie recipes.Especially when I don't want to heat up the kitchen. This is the cookie my family fights over.,positive
I have two hungry teenage boys and they absolutly love this dish. We have made it one of our special weekend dinners. Mashed taters and green beans with rolls makes this a very filling meal.,positive
"My husband raved about this chili. It's definitely a keeper. To cut down on the high grease content so commonly found in chili, I used Laura's Lean Beef.",positive
"Easy to make and absolutely delicious.A perfect combination of moist, sweet and tart tastes. This will certainly be a recipe that we will use often.",positive
I made this recipe 4 times in the last 3 weeks it was really a big hit with my family. My son especially loved it beacause he can reheat and eat ... And its very simple and quick.,positive
I sure never ate these in Naples but they were good for sunny afternoons in Massachusetts too.,positive
Really easy and good!Even better as left overs!,positive
"Rich and creamy!Great for kids and adults alike, they look quite nice too - like the nuts from the Buckeye tree (hence there name LOL)WARNING: These are highly additive!",positive
"My grandmother also made this wonderful dish.It was the only way she could get her kids to eat cabbage.Same as with my mother,and now with my own kids.This stuff is pure comfort food.",positive
"Instead of cooking onion(I substituted white onions) and mushrooms in water, I sauteed in butter til tender. I increased mushrooms to an 8oz container and used 8 oz of cheese. Very tasty. I'd call this a meatless lasagna. I think this will become a family favorite.(Prep time was approximately 45 minues. It could be shortened if you fry eggplant in 2 pans instead of waiting to use the one.)",positive
"Dearest Lali,I have just finished making this and within the last 10 minutes this has become my most favourite pudding, I love it more than I could ever put down in words, it is so easy to make, so tasty, the colour is so ""sexy"", the taste is yummmmmmm yummmmmmmmmmy and I think if I wasn't on a health kick, I would have finished it all just now onlyI think I could eat the hands of the person who typed this delicious recipe, oh I love it soo osoooooooo muchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!I request the founders of Recipezaar to make it the RECIPE OF THE DAY soon, it's so tasty and so easy, I hope every person in this world gets to eat this and moreover share it with many more!Last but not the least, A JUMBO SIZED HUG TO U for this ooooooh special yummmmmmy lovely pudding.",positive
"I used the suggestion of Bob LeBlanc and it was wonderful.I found out that half waythrough the cooking process, I needed to add more water (or broth) I added a 1 1/2 cups more.At the last 20 minutes of cooking I added a cup of 1/2 and 1/2 (we use the fat free one).The recipe made about 16 cups of soup.It only took 20 minutes to fry bacon, then the potato mix and the rest was put in the crckpot and stirred occasionaly.",positive
I made this for supper tonight and I can not believe how tender it is.I love this meal!,positive
"this receipe was simple and incredibley delicious.As mentioned before, just start in the morning and when you get home you have perfectly cooked and seasoned chicked.Great for enchiladas, burritos, taocs, what ever!!Try it!Vicky",positive
This recipe was great. It was my first time making Chili and I made a few changes. I used venison instead of beef and I added some bell pepper (2) and some fresh jalapeno's (6) and it was awesome!!!!,positive
Absolutely wonderful! I pinched off the dough instead of rolling it (easier that way),positive
This is just how Momma made them back home in the Eastern TN mountains!,positive
"Spicy, zingy, bold, yet full of subtle nuance. Incredibly simple to make, and a little goes a LONG way. I tried it with home grown basil on bowties with some diced sundried tomatos, and YUMMMMM.... Lovely color as well!",positive
"Oh.... my.. GAWD.... This is SALSA NIRVANA!!! I've never tasted anything like this in my life. I made it for a party, and people were practically tackling each other to get to it! I had to make another batch! Not super hot, but you could ""kick it up a notch"" with more jalapeno if you wanted, I suppose. VERY tart and citrus-laced. Lots of body, color, and visual appeal. Try it on burgers, chili, almost anything!!!Bonstr, whoever you are, BOTTLE THIS STUFF!!! You'll be rich.",positive
This is awesome! I just microwaved it. It was so easy. Love it!,positive
"Nice, good, pleasing to the taste budsI liked the name as well, sounds rooooomanntic!!",positive
"Oh well, it is so good! I wished while I was baking this cake that I were a spoon or bowl in which the ingredients were mixed by me to make it.I used 1 cup (minus 1 tbsp) of Fresh milk and added 1 tbsp of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. Rest of the things I have stuck to this recipe. It's a very nice cake and quite easy too. The fact that it is eggless makes it all the more nice as many people I know don't have eggs at all, hence, I have many more soon going to be ""lovers"" of this cake! I'd say that if your depressed or low, request mom to make this for u if u love cakes n chocolate - Just put in 1 pieceof cake and watch your depression run away for miles from you Last but not the least, I loved the deep dark brown colour of the cake when done. I garnished it with some chopped almonds and maraschino cherries that made it look all the more yummy and mouth watering and oh well, my stomach says ""Give me more of Depression Fudge cake now and NOW means NOWWWWWW""!!!",positive
"Can I come over to your house?? Man, everything you've submitted so far is STELLAR!!! Where did you learn to cook? These egg rolls have great color, texture, taste, and they are easy (albeit a bit messy) to make! You need lots of counter space for this one, but it's worth it! Try it with teryaki wings!!!",positive
I had left over sweet potatoes sOoooooo I used them and I used canned Manderin oranges. I used a 1/2 tsp cayenne.MMMmmmDorothy this is a very tasty dish. I'll do it againThanks Bergy,positive
"Oh, what a great idea! phyllo dough and ground beef! I tried it with the cinnamon and stuff, and it tasted very Greek, like a pasticcio. I made another one without those 2 sweet spices, and it was more Italian. You can make a huge variation in the taste just by varying the spice mix a little bit.Yummy! I think I'm gonna gain weight, but oh well, food is love.Please, post more recipes!!!",positive
I made this recipe and used it for a topping on pancakes.My family inhaled all of it.Terrific recipe.,positive
"Outstanding, easy, satisfying.I used reduced fat swiss cheese and a bit more than a dash of worcestershire sauce.A great recipe!Thanks!!",positive
"My family loved this recipe.The recipe makes ample sauce which has a sweet and sour taste. We served the chicken over white rice and the sauce added flavor to the rice also. Try this recipe, it's a nice dish to serve to guests also.",positive
"This is the most luscious carrot cake ever! It is so easy to make, esp if you have a food processor to shred the carrots. Bravo Carol!",positive
I have made this recipe and it is great but try putting dip inside the bowl and baking for 2 hours on 250 or until center is good and hot and bread bowl is starting to crisp.Excellent.,positive
"This is so quick, and so good!I buy the Grands Crescent rolls, that way you only need one can.My sister told me when she saw it, ""I am not a 'real' veggie eater"".She tried a piece and LOVED it!<p>I've also used Taco Seasoning instead of the ranch dressing!Topped with lettuce, tomatoes, black olives, hot peppers . . . etc!It's GREAT!",positive
"this dish was very simple and quick to make,and used hardly any ingredients. i did however change the garlic powder to chopped garlic and it worked a treat. i served the lamb korabiak with baby carrots that had been steamed in the oven in foil in plenty of sugar, salt, pepper and mixed herbs and the whole dish was absoloutly delicious, the best iv`e tasted in a long time!",positive
Absolutely the best meatloaf I've ever eaten!Delicious!,positive
This was excellent! I was craving this sauce for days and it was exactly like I remember. I skimped on the time I took to simmer it and it was still excellent.,positive
I would have never thought of scalloped potatoes in the crockpot.I added ham chunks for a main dish.Yummy.,positive
Wonderful cake.It is also very good with dates instead of the prunes.,positive
this is great.a perfect sauce for dipping the leaves in.,positive
"They aren't bad, but I've made better. These tended to be more biscuity than others I've had. They were a little heavy. Most recipes I've used call for more sugar and use cream. I think that would help them. Also brushing melted butter over the top before you bake them is nice.",neutral
The chicken parmesan was very easy to make. I liked that it didn't require a lot of ingredients.I cooked my chicken steaks on the George Foreman grill which made it even faster.,positive
"I have tried many Chili recipes and this one was the best.I did not do the blender thing but it still turned out wonderful!!!! I added extra spices to make it hotter, but the consistency and flavor were excellent.I would give it a try!!",positive
This is the first time I have canned salsa and this one is AWESOME! I'm going to make another batch because everyone that tries it will want some.,positive

I just can't believe how much fat is in this recipe. yuck!!!,negative
This tasted like it came from a specialty coffee shop.Yummy!!!!,positive
Easy to make. Recipe did stipulate what to do with cinnamon and extra flour. Taste was ok.,neutral
"I found it a little salty, but that would be easily solved by using a low sodium soup.I would also recommend that you drain the juice from the chicken before adding the other ingredients, as the final product was quite runny until it was chilled.I would like to try this without the velveeta as well... if anyone has tried this let me know how you did it.Serving it with a toasted garlic ciabbatta bun really topped it off.",neutral
"Good Recipe,my kids loved it.",positive
"This is Good.Especially if you like Stewed Tomatoes.I always put bread on top of my stewed tomatoes, this is just a kind of a ""twist"" to stewed tomatoes.",positive
"This is VERY GOOD!!!I've made this two ways.I made per the instructions AND, I sliced the meat, used the marinade and stir fried it.OMG!!! This was soooo good. Served with fried rice. Mmm Mmm",positive

"This is FANTASTIC!!!Instead of the oil, I fried a few strips of bacon that I cut up.And, I also added a couple of ribs of celery.For the whole k. corn I used white corn.Very Good GAY!!!",positive
How Funny!,positive
"I used this recipe, with a few slight modifications to compliment recipe 8224, Fried Rice (Chow Fun).I had a package of a cheap cut of beef (simmering steak) and was looking for a suitable marinade for it. This recipe looked good and so I gave it a go. I deboned and removed most of the fat from the steak and cut it into three inch strips about three eighths of an inch wide.I also scaled the recipe in a few places to compensate for the amount of meat I had to marinate. I also added 2 tablespoons of honey, and a pinch of Basil, just because I like honey and Basil. Also, I used red wine vinegar for the 2nd ingredient.After whisking in a large measuring cup for a bit, I tipped the marinade into a large ""Zip-Lock"" freezer bag. The meat, having been pierced, went into the bag, the bag was sealed, and everything was given a few turns around and about in the bag. I set the bag into a meat loaf pan and put it into the refrigerator. I turned the bag every hour, and the whole affair was in the fridge for about 7 hours before cooking in my wok.I am pleased to say that an otherwise cheap piece of meat was transformed into a tender and extremely tasty dish.One thing I have learned about marinades… you have to take them on faith. They sometimes smell horrible, even to the point where I though about tossing it out and starting over again. I'm glad I didn't… bad smell ultimately led to a fabulous taste.Another 5 star rating from me for this recipe.",positive

"I agree with the recipe description: simple, but good! This sald tastes like many of the deli salads available in grocery stores or salad bars. I served it with another Recipezaar dish Greek Phyllo Chicken. The creamy dressing adds flavor to the crisp vegetables.",positive

This was a definate hit in our household.Added 1/2 seeded and chopped Jalapeno pepper for a little extra zip.,positive

"I tried this recipe today - making it for someone else - but absolutely had to take some home for myself!!It was not only ""world famous"" it is ""out of this world famous!!""I cooked it a bit longer to really crisp it up - and changed it to two servings - but still used enough chicken to fill up an 8 x 10 baking pan.I think I used more sour cream than called for in my scaled down recipe too - but - really and truly it is ""to die for!!!""He's not lyin!!",positive

"This recipe is almost exactly what my Grandmother called ""Boiled Cake"". She said it was originally ""made up"" because the ingredients for a regular cake were notalways available.This is one of my favorite cakes--great to take to a pot luck, or office party.It tasteswonderful, packs well and everyone loves it.The only difference is she used lard, my mother substituted Crisco when they boiled thesugar (they used white sugar), water, raisins, etc. together. And of course, they did notalways have nuts on hand so they were omitted a lot.Wonderful cake!Just a side effect -- when the mixture is boiling the entire house gets that spicy cookingsmell that brings the whole family into the kitchen saying ""what smells so wonderful).",positive
Wowwee!This was fun and no singed eye brows. I used Asian apple pears (there are a lot of locally grown ones around this year) and they were delicious.Thanks for another great recipe Dorothy.Cheers Bergy,positive

"I am becoming a pasta fan with recipes like this one!!This was excellent, simple and quick.I, too, used skim milk but I added to the fat by replacing one can of tuna with a can of smoked oysters.Hope everyone uses real parmesan cheese and not the cardboard stuff.It makes a difference.Thank for the recipe.",positive
"Well really Bergy, this was just outstanding!!I used 6 skinless/boneless breasts, had to defrost them so I put them in the juice from the aprcots in the fridge overnight, then dried them on paper towel before rolling them in the spices.Followed the recipe exactly after that.In any case my friend thought I did find something ""sumtuous and new"" and went home with the recipe. Thank-you for the marvelous taste!!",positive
good stuff,positive
"Today was the perfect ""apple crisp"" kind of day, but I didn't have Granny Smith's.I decided to use what I had - 10 McIntosh - and the results are great!I liked having cornstarch mixed in with the apples to thicken the juice.Also, I had never drizzled melted butter on top of the ""crisp"" mixture, and that was a nice change. Thanks!",positive
Easy and Yummy. I doubled the flour andspices. After coating the chicken I browned in oil on top of the stove. I added the left over flour and spices to the broth.I also added a can of Rotel tomatos with chili's.I cooked in a ceramic casserole dish with a lid at 450 for same amount of time. Chicken was so tender it fell off thebone.,positive

The only thing I had a little problem with was the oz. configurations. I added 2 cans of chopped apricots to the mixture (I had to scale the recipe to 10) that I chopped and used that juice along with a cup of orange juice instead of water. It was used over pork during and after cooking time.My entire family and guest enjoyed it. I was also asked for the recipe.,positive
"I did tone down the sugar a bit after reading the previous comments.I used all of the brown sugar, and I used just a pinch of the white sugar.I won't even bother with it at all next time... and there will be a next time.The directions are perfect.It took exactly an hour, and the sweet sauce smelled ridiculously good while cooking.I kept saying, ""Is it done yet?Can we eat it yet?!""It was well worth the wait.I'm going to make it again this week.It was hard to make it last, but two of us ate the meatloaf for three days.Even great reheated.",positive
once you find out how easy it is to make this yourself you will never buy it premade again.as with all things homemade it tastes much better as well.,positive
"from gay: What did I do wrong?My loaf tastes raw and very much like beer.Don't get me wrong, I like beer but this just tastes uncooked... (btw, i had to make my own self-raising flour using another recipe here because it isn't common in the US).Also, it turned out crusty and pretty ugly looking.",negative
easy and delicious.I used 2 Tablespoons of julienned fresh ginger instead of dried and 6 carrots took more like 12 minutes to cook. Everyone loved it.,positive
"I make this at least once a week; however, I use a large nonstick frying pan. Two or three mins per side is all it takes. More often than not, I add slivered deli ham in with the cheese and serve with salsa on the side, sometimes sour cream too. And try making a quesadilla with brie cheese and thinly sliced granny smith apple...it's yummy!",positive

"If you change the t table spoons cream cheese to 8 ounce pack of cream cheese its better the Olive Gardens.

easy and my kids love it.You can use any brand of ham.We like even more cheese placed on top as it cools and sets.,neutral
"Ingredients of this recipe suggested that the flavor and texture of the loaf would be lacking and sweetness of the topping overwhelming. But because meatloaf is a favorite dish of mine the 5 star rating given this recipe challenged me to try it. I cut the sugar for the topping by a third. Still, I found the topping sickeningly sweet and the texture and bland flavor unimpressive.",negative

"Made this tonight with a slight modification: used strips of skinless boneless chicken breasts instead of drumsticks and used a combination of carrots, green beans and snow peas instead of only carrots. It was easy and delicious; I will make it again. I just wish the ""sauce"" was a little thicker, so I will use more cornstarch next time and likely cook it uncovered near the end.",positive
"Cheers to Aunt Vivian! Made this dish tonight for the first time (have had it in restaurants in the American South though) and it was a hit with my family. It's easy, makes a lot, and is very tasty. My only advice is to make it ahead of time; I made it at 4 and served it at 7 and the cookies were still too crunchy (but still yummy of course).",positive

Excellent......real good taste...,positive
"Love both oysters and mushrooms, these were wonderful, only thing I changed was the milk, only had 2%, I don't think it made much difference because I switched - used 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup 2%, it seemed to make up for the 2%, in any case, this was a great supper, Thanks for a great taste treat!!

This was very good.I made a cheese sauce to go on top.First I made a roue of 2 T crisco melted in a pan then added about 1 T of flour stirred in real good so there were no lumps.I browned it slightly and added about 1-2 c. of milk.This I thickened and added some velveeta cheese about1/2 of a big log.Then I added about 1 c Rotel tomatoes.Stir until cheese is melted.Youn may add salt and pepper if you like.Add this on top of the chimichangas.Delicious.(these measurement are approx.) You could also put chili on top.I also added about 1 c. of cheddar cheese to my refried beans and some milk to make it creamy,positive

"WOW! I'd never used a base like that for a baked alaska... I always made a merengue base and ""filled"" it with ice cream, froze and then covered in merengue to cook... nice touch on it.As a twist you could use choc chip mint ice cream... I'm sure that would make it even more amazing, although the contrast between the vainilla and the choc-mint base should be great.I'll make this next time I remember to buy ice cream!!!!! (as in tomorrow) Added to my cookbook!!!",positive
Oh! yum yum yum... It looks like we share taste in more than just Feta cheese. The toasted bread is a perfect touch... but croutons are fun if you're serving this at a dinner party (nice starter dont you think?).I'll see if I can post a baked alaska recipe for you that you dont already have )),positive

I didn''t use the Ragu pizza sauce but instead a chunker pasta sauce (Classico tomato-basil) which I think was good.I also added chicken and ham.,positive
These are good! They remind me of hoe cakes my mama used to make.,positive
I made a double batch because it said 4 servings but I now have enough soup to feed a small army - I will freeze some for later. I only used 3 1.25 oz. pkgs of taco seasoning and it was perfect.

This Is definitley the best stew i have had yet i used beef insead of Venison since i didnt have anybut i also added 1 tablespoon of liquid smoke Marinade WOW!! its great you can also cook this is a crock pot for 6 hours on high,positive
"I rated this so high for two reasons: 1, it was SO easy! 2, All of my brunch guests loved it!I did, however, use frozen hash browns in place of O'Brien potatoes. I also added some cubed ham with the broccoli, and used milk to mix with eggs instead of water.",positive

Excellent recipe. The gravy is fantastic. We can''t wait to make it again.,positive

This is so good and just as yummy if you use strawberries instead of the raspberries. East to do and so pretty on the plate.,positive
"I made this a few days ago and it turned out terrific.I was sceptical of black olives, but this is a major goat cheese household ;-).Honestly, worked great.Didn't have the cream though, so just used a splash of milk and more potato water -- this was the first time I learned this trick and it works and keeps the fat down in the finished product.Keeper!",positive

"This is a very traditional recipe.My grandfather came from sweden and we had it often.He is gone now but we still keep the tradition alive at holiday time.The trick is not to cook the fish too long or it will be soft and it's the texture that "" makes it or breaks it.""a funny story tells about a woman who had skunks under her house and she was told to put lutefisk in the basement and theywould leave.It worked but thenshe couldn'tget rid of the norwegians! The lye was obviously a preservative; these days you can buy it frozen. If dried lute fisk is used, do not use sterling silverware or the lye will darken it.",positive

"I love worcestershire sauce, but the tablespoon called for in this recipe is far too much. The flavour overpowered the dish. Other than that, my husband and I both liked this, although my teenage son was not thrilled. I substituted 2 cups of ""winter mix"" for the frozen mixed veg (it's a combination of frozen broccoli and cauliflower my grocery store sells, essentially California Mix without the carrots) and suspect that 2 cups of any frozen veg would be fine. This was also quite easy to prepare, and made for a quick dinner.",neutral

i made it without the chicken and it was still great,positive
"Loved your pot roast! The thickened juices were especially good. I used olive oil, didn't have any canola oil,doubled the garlic and used diced tomatoes. Did not know what browning sauce is, so I left it out. I don't think it made much difference. Also used less flour. We are looking forward to the leftovers, cubed the meat, added it to the jucies with left over carrots and potatoes, for tomorrow. Very good Sunday dinner thanks!! Dorothy",positive

This is a really great chicken dish.,positive
"This was soooo Good!!!!!! Should be called Garlic lovers chicken!!As for time - it took 10 - 15 minutes to prepare and about 25 minutes cooking timeMore than enough for 2 servings. Great reacipe because one can expand on it to suit it to our taste and to the number of diners.I only used 3 tablespoons of olive oil instead of 5. I followed the recipe after that,except, I added some stuff out of the fridge. Last 6 or 8 minutes of cooking, I added, about 6 chopped green onions,1/2 cup each red and green sweet peppers and about 4 large florets of cauliflower.We had about a foot each of thin, very crusty, caraway french bread with it!!!!!Could not leave a drop of the juices. Absolutely delicious and will be repeated again and again. Thank-you Recipezaar!!!Dorothy",positive

"The recipe produces an authentic South of the Border Carne Guisada.This is one of my favorite Mexican dishes.I added 2 cubed potatoes and added them as I browned the meat, cooked it about ten minutes and added the rest of the ingredients and simmered for 20 minutes. Instead of using plain tomatoes, I added two cans of diced tomatoes (10 ounces)with green chiles. Now I guess I'll have to make homemade flour tortillas to go with this.",positive

Try it again with fresh coriander Bergy..its delicious!! ,positive
"Excellent!This one was quite a hit for our ""dip as you can"" dinner on Halloween night while we served candy to the goblins at the front door.My one comment on this area of recipezaar in general...WHERE ARE THE LOW CARB FOODS?None of these are low carb so far, though if you left off the chips on this one, it might come close.However, it'd be too rich to handle.",positive
"Forget the calories. . . this is good.It makes a goodly amount as well.I did this for halloween and was pleased to find not all of it was give out to the ghosts and gobblins.It was my ""treat"" for halloween!!Glad you posted this recipe.",positive

"I did 1 experimental batch of 6 small jars. I'm now down to 3 jars and this is such a hit with my family that I'm making another dozen jars as holiday gifts. It is truly wonderful salsa. My only complaint is the act of peeling tomatoes seems to ruin my finger nails. Oh well, it is a small price to pay for this good stuff.",positive
I prepared this dish last night for dinner.It was absolutely delicious!I reduced the amount of butter for us and it was great.The sour cream really keeps the chicken moist and the breading was just right to add good flavor.,positive
"this recipe was delicious... actually i didn't freeze the two dishes.I made one 9x13 size pan of lasagna.Also, I layered the lasagna in the morning, then refrigerated until time to pop it in the oven that evening and the pasta was tender.no need to pre cook it.I did add a layer of seasoned/browned ground round to satisfy my family.",positive

"This is just superb!Exactly my type of dish, the colours were great, and the flavour mmm mmmm. Will be making this again and again and.....",positive
"The combination of crescent rolls and savory chicken filling was delicious. If you ever want to jazz up a chicken salad sandwich, this filling would go well on any type of bread. The ingredients blend well together. I used low fat canned chcicken as a time saver and reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat crescent rolls to save on calories. Would go well with a salad.",positive
"Easy to make, a little sweet for my liking, but very good.",neutral

This soup is the easest and the most delicious soup I have ever had. Elena Olivieri,positive
I was truly disappointed in this recipe. To begin with it is a mixture of Metric and US measurements. I adjusted the best I could configure and then some. It made a small amount of dough-not enough to even bother to cut. I just patted it out and baked it. Now granted the taste was good. I will look elsewhere for something similar.,negative

"My family loved this recipe and it was very easy to make.It was a little bit runny, but no harm -we just scooped up the sauce and piled in on top of some freshly toasted garlic bread.Yummy!My finicky daughter wants me to serve the sauce with pasta all the time now!Tip - Add a beaten egg and fresh parmesan cheese the cottage cheese to help firm it up a bit.",positive

That's a lot of cheese for such a small amount of pasta!No wonder Reagan has Alzheimer's!I upped the pasta to a full pound and added a dash of paprika for flavor.Even with the mustard it was a little bland.,neutral
I added a can of corned beef to this recipe and my family liked it better than fried corned beef and cabbage.,positive
"This is a very quick and easy recipe that can be adapted to a Solo meal ... and works great in the microwave. For enough sauce to meet the needs of a cup of dried pasta, use 2 ounces each of cream cheese and milk, and one ounce of butter. Microwave on high for about a minute and 45 seconds. Take it out, stir, and add a couple ounces or more of parmesan cheese. Stiring in the parmesan cheese last willhelp thicken the sause.",positive
"I have to admit I haven't tried your recipe BUT, I was just in Cancun and tried this drink. One sip and I was hooked!!! It is wonderful and goes down sssooooo easy. I am so glad that you had the recipe. Now I can make it for my friends and family and also enjoy it myself at home.",positive

"I made this bread a few hours agoand it is gone already,my husband ate almost the whole loaf by himself,I thought it was delicious too,being made in a bread machine it was very easy to make,the hard part was smelling it and waiting to eat it,it smelled wonderful.I made it exactly like the recipe said,butI think next time I will put a little garlic in it.I would give it a 5 star rating",positive
I love banana bread and this is my mom's recipe (posted under my dad's name). I've tried just about every Banana Bread recipe on the site and this is the best. I've eaten it since I was a kid and still enjoy it today (just finished a couple slices in fact). I don't know what it is that makes it so good... maybe it's the use of frozen bananas instead of fresh ones as my mom always did?,positive
I baked the cake in a fan forced owen for 15 minutes and it turned too crusty and hard. I could not cut it into two so I had to decorate the cake as it is. I don't know what but something went wrong somewhere!,negative

"i would add more rum and creme de menthe next time as the pears seemed to really absorb it. this really is easy to do and they come out great! i also tried this recipe using strawberries and peaches.they came out just as good as the pears. i added more rum to the peaches and i didn't use creme de menthe for either one, i sued brandy with the rum for both instead.",neutral
"This, I must admit is very good.I used crushed pretzels instead of the crackers and shredded parmasan.My fiance loved it.I was a little worried it would be to heavy because of all the butter, but after about 2 bites, I didn't care anymore!Good good good!",positive
I omitted the yogurt and this was really tasty with pakoras.,positive
This rice is superb!The only thing missing was a little hot pepper.Instead of topping the rice with the fresh vegetables I mixed it in to the hot rice and let the heat cook the veggies a bit.,positive
Delicious and easy.Versatile recipe that can be used for many dishes.Thank you for sharing.,positive
This is a great recipe and it really does taste like an Orange Julius drink.It makes a big batch and is fun to make.,positive

"LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!I only used 3 med. to large bananas and used 1/2 c. turbinado sugar and 1/2 c. white sugar, still turned out great.Of course, flavor is even richer after a day or so.",positive
"This soup is very creamy and yummy!The peanut butter adds a nice, complimentary flavor.MODIFICATIONS: I added twice as much red pepper and a little cumin.I also suggest modifying the recipe to add the rice after you puree the squash, if you like whole rice in your soup.Regardless, the flavor is outstanding.",positive
This recipe sounded like a great idea.I tried steaming the collard greens over the stovetop for nearly 2 hours and could not get them cooked enough to taste good.Maybe I did not do something right?I am sticking to boiling collard greens from now on.,negative
Easy and yummy!,positive
"This is a very good side dish to serve along corned beef or fried chicken.The recipe calls for white cornmeal if possible, but I find that yellow cornmeal makes for an ""earthier"" cornbread.",positive
"What a novel idea to have potatoes in the meatball mix!I used my regular meatball recipe and added the potatoes.I boiled them up in a combination of broth and cranberry sauce, and this was a truly superb appetizer!",positive

"I made this recipe for a family the other day, thought the kids would really like it.Just did it on the stove and couldn't believe how easy it was - and how yummy! I only added one can of beans, and it seemed like enough for them.I made it last night for my husband and I - and he just absolutely loved it!It is sort of like chili - but not.It really is a taco in a bowl. We put the corn chips on the bottom and then topped the soup with cheese and sour cream.It is very filling and satisfying - and so easy and delicious - all the right ingredients.Next time I will try it in the crockpot!",positive
"I thought these would be very good but I'm sorry to say they were not.Way, way to much oil and they were not seasoned enough.I may try the method again but not this recipe.Sorry",negative

This was fantastic. My kids loved it!,positive
"This was a big hit in our house.We did leave out the cilantro, we don't like it very much.",positive
Absolutely wonderful! Made it last night to serve with dinner tonight and my MIL was thrilled; said she hadn't had it in years. I too used an English cucumber and rice vinegar. This is about the easiest side dish you can serve! Next time I will definitely add onion.,positive

"This is excellent! I made it on the stove today in my AMC cookware. It was a real delight! I had an uncle come home for lunch and he said to tell you that he loved it! I omitted the olives and cheese. I did add 2 potatoes and I fried the caulifower pieces in hot oil, drained it and then added the pieces to the capsicums. I also added jeera for seasoning. Besides that, I added a few chopped tomato pieces for additional colour. But this istruly excellent dish, colourful and can brighten up anyone's day!!

"WOW!! This soup was amazing. It has a flavor unlike anything else I hjave ever tasted. Very exotic, sweet, but mild; great cold weather soup. This was so good I took it to work and shared it with a coworker, because I knew she would love it too.I used canned chickpeas, and added cardamon and a pinch of five star powder. My taste buds just thought the flavor would be complemented with the additions.",positive
"These squares are extremely sweet; they even overwhelmed a diehard sweet tooth like myself. I baked these up for a group of teenagers, and they did go over well with them. The frosting is very good; I can't wait to try it on a plain cake or, perhaps, banana. Do pour the frosting onto the brownies as soon as possible, as it starts to stiffen very quickly. If I bake this recipe again, I will reduce the sugar in the brownies down to 1 cup, and likely up the cocoa.",neutral
"this was okay, just seemed to be lacking in flavor. Used leftover salmon from roasted salmon the night before and it just tasted a bit blah.perhaps I have too high of an expectation for salmon patties, but I think it could be jazzed up with something else...teriyaki?",neutral
"This was okay,but kind of bland.Nest time I make it,I will substitute imittation crab,and maybe some canned tiny shrimp,will use some Old Bay seasoning and garlic.",neutral
"Wow this recipe makes a lot of food.The oregano and lemon juice were a little overpowering, I would reduce them by half.When I re-heated some left-overs I added some hot italian sausage that I had pre-cooked - it was a marriage made in heaven!!",neutral

Plus - I once tried to feed walnuts to the squirrels outside my window. Ha!",negative
"Tasted good, but the sauce just got too thick to really amount to much.It tasted good, but I think the sauce should really just cook off the alcohol and then reduce to just thicker than an aus ju.The garlic just makes it too thick after reducing the wine to syrup.",neutral

"This wasn't as delicious as I'd expected. It's just about okie. It was ready in the microwave in 4 minutes. In 5-6 minutes, it was horrible, it's better to stop in 4 minutes only. I whisked it once again after removing it from the oven. Then, I added 3 cups of milk and whisked again.Then, I kept it in the refrigerator. I'm not tooo happy with it. Something's missing in it :(",neutral

This one was a train wreck.I cut the recipe in half and was glad not to waste more ingredients.It had the worst flavor of ketchup.No one in our large family would eat it and had to throw the entire thing away.This was one of those recipes that we wonder how anyone could make this and think it's good.,negative
Very easy and fun to make.I forgot cranberries popped when boiled.,neutral

I lost my most favourite mixing dish because of this recipe.I'd loved your ""Apple bread"" and thought this would be just as tasty as that, but, you've gone wrong with the measurement of the quantity of milk this recipe needs.

"It was nice, but I'm not very fond of ginger, and the sweet-n-spicy tang the chutney had just didn't quite appeal to me. It's sort of a cross between apple jam and pickle.

"The recipie has alot of promise, but it needs some tweeking.The first batch out of the oven were undercooked in the center.Next batch I flattend a bit and they came out better,the third batch I flattend to 3/8 thick and it seemed to work fine. They are very tender and are very attractive as they crack slightly and have a nice light brown hue around the perimeter.With the texture issues solved solved I would like to work on the flavor as they are a bit flat for my tastes,and for what I think a Christmas Cookie should be......I think some ground nut and more extract would be a big help.",neutral

What about the creamy white sauce. Corned beef needs this to be VERY YUMMY. check out my recipes I have a recipe for white sauce that I use on corned beef.,neutral
"I made this one evening after our grill mysteriously ran out of gas.It was a good dish ,but next time I will cut down on the amount of water used.Had a very interesting flavor, sweet, yet spicy.Worth a try.",neutral
I found this to be a little bland.I may add some hot sauce to give it a kick.,neutral
These were very tasty just the way they are but something was missing so I think I am going to try them again but add a bit of spicey mustard to the mayo and maybe include a strip or 2 of crisp bacon.I have had the KFC twisters when they were selling them here and loved them.,neutral
A lot better than it sounds but VERY sweet.,neutral

"I was disappointed in the flavor.I thought that they would have a lot of orange taste and would be sweet.They weren't.However, it does have possibilities.I am going to play with this recipe and maybe double the oranges and the sweetner to see if I can produce what I was expecting when I tried this one.",neutral
"I agree with gay. Also too many ingredients makes a dish too complictated, I would say a few of the spices could have been left out. It had a nice flavour though!",neutral
"I had this for dinner tonight. Normally, we just have noodles with lots of vegetables in it when in the mood for the same. Tonight, it was a little different with this recipe in hand. It was nice having mushrooms tossed in as well. Instead of cilantro, I garnished it with spring onions(my favourite!). The vegetables I added to the noodles were 2 capsicums, chopped, 1 carrot, chopped, 50-75gms onions, 1/2 cabbage and 100 gms French beans. Try it with these, it'll be more delicious!! I omitted the Chinese wine as I don't have it at the moment and haven't used it till date.",neutral
It was a big disappointment and it flopped.I did not MIX OR STIR.I would never make it again.,negative
"Nice enough, but a little too greasy! 1/2 tablespoon of butter per serving is a little too much for a recipe that doesn't have many veggies. I skipped the mushrooms and doubled the amount of green bell peppers and it gave the rice a nice flavour.",neutral
"It's nice, chilled is even better, but the onions were the cause of it not being extremely tasty. May I suggest you add few chopped olives instead of the onions. Otherwise, it was indeed a tongue tickler.",neutral
"I did not like the taste that tarragon added to this recipe.I was completely turned off by the flavor, but I guess that wasn't the recipe's fault but the tarragon's.I would like to maybe try this recipe again and use the marjoram.

I found this to be lacking in flavor somewhat. I will try again at some point and maybe add more seasoning.,neutral
I used 1 lb of chicken and reduced the soups to 1 can of the cream of chicken and 1 can of cheddar cheese soup.Added minced garlic rather than the powder.Cooked on low 6 hours.The chicken turned out a little dry even though it was totally coveredy by the sauce.Think I should have reduced the cook time to 4 or 5 hours.Sauce was still good!,neutral
There seems to be a lot of coconut milk for such a small quanitity of stock.I also think there is too much chicken in this recipe and will use less than 1 lb.It is only 3 cups so the ratio of 1 1/4 lbs of chicken to 3 cups of soup just doesnt jive,negative
This was definitely a horrid cake.The water called for was too much and the taste was bland and unsatisfying.Please do not try this one.,negative

"These cookies were something different. But, I'd like to make a few suggestions based on how I made them today.Firstly, on mixing the dry ingredients with the butter-oil mixture, I didn't get a soft dough. What I got was something similar to ""boondis"" i.e., small round balls. I made these into round balls(just like we make ladoos) and then baked them for 24 minutes. Once these were cooled, I dipped them in the topping.For the topping, I suggest to heat sugar and water together and once the sugar has melted, to add the honey. Allow to simmer for 2-3 minutes.Then, dip the cooled cookies into this syrup and after removing from the syrup, arrange in a serving tray/dish and then sprinkle with nuts.Initially, I made the topping as the recipe says, but the problem was that the whole thing hardened up within seconds and made it very difficult for me. That's why I came up with the idea mentioned above. Another thing, I could make only 1 dozen cookies and not 3 dozen as per the measurements mentioned in this recipe.Overall, it was okie, something different from usual cookies.",neutral
This was a very good dish....the rosemary and thyme made all the difference. This is a keeper.,neutral
THE RECIPE is very easy to cook .but its taste is very bad.,negative
This was a good basic recipe.,neutral
Recipe was easy to make but my husband and I did not like the flavour and found it to be too rich.Would not make it again.,negative

"The recipe was very easy to follow, the cookies had a very pleasant taste, and I would certainly offer them to friends who appreciate low fat foods. However; as a person who is not used to low fat baking, these cookies seemed a little boring when compared to a Toll house cookie, but of course that is a matter of personal preference.",neutral
"This was a big hit at my dinner party, however, I felt there didn't seem to be a big flavor.Maybe they should be marinated to pick up more of the taste.",neutral

"This is a great way to use up turkey left-overs.I used chopped already roasted turkey, fresh mushrooms and some fresh brocolli.I didn't have any water chestnuts, so I omitted them.I also added some Chinese Chow Mein Noodles (dried) at the end and let them steam for a couple of minutes.I will make this again......",neutral
Use crunchy peanut butter and use honey insteadof sugar and they really taste like sweet peanuts.,neutral
"The combination of the ginger and the bananas was a little weird. I had 5 people try it, and none thought that it was horrible, but all agreed that it tasted like bananas trying to be apples (ie, the spices were more suited for a apple recipe). If you like the combination of bananas and ginger, you might like this recipe. I definitly will not make it again though.",negative
"It is an easy way to include fruits and vegetables in your diet by making salsa. Try using cilantro (green coriander) and fruits like plums, strawberries, and peaches. I cut everything in chunks and then chop and mix (couple of rounds)in a food processor.",neutral

This is a great dish for something quick. We added 1/4 of an onion to zing it up a little. Served with Rice it was great.,neutral
This was ok- not great.I reduced the sugars and the filling was still sweet but runny.I would recommend boiling the apples first with sugar and about 2 Tbsp. of water in a pot so the filling is basically done and thick and then bake it.,neutral
"1) overall, not as flavorful as I would have expected -- would increase amount of spices next time2) definitely not ""just 5 minutes"", heck it takes 15 just to boil the potatoes3) not sure what is the best way to SLOWLY make the sesame seeds ""crackle"" b/c if you heat the oil to medium-high and toss in the seeds = instant crackle/browning and splattering oil (not a good scene).Best is probably to heat the oil to medium-low, add seeds and let crackle, add other seasonings, then turn up to medium-high (I would avoid high) and add potatoes.4) other issue is how much oil to use?From my experience, I think the best is to cover the bottom of a large skillet with ~1/3in. of oil (use canola or olive to reduce polyunsat fat).",neutral
"Quick and easy. Great for those cold mornings be-fore work,or for chicken and dumplings.",neutral

"Hmmm. I served this delicious dessert (very easy to make, too) to my family tonight, but it wasn't Chocolate Mocha Pudding, more like Chocolate Mocha Soup. Either the recipe's cornstarch amount is wrong, or the chilling time is underestimated; I don't know what else would be the cause. It had chilled for just over 4 hours. We all agreed the taste was terrific, but the consistency left a lot to be desired.",neutral

"These were the worst tasting cookies i've ever eaten! Too salty, not sweet enough and in your recipe you do not use any butter or margarine. And in the recipe you say baking soda, but in the instructions youstate baking powder which is it! I will not reccommend this recipe to my worst enemy.",negative

We all felt like this dish was missing something.I think next time that I will up the chili powder to 2 Tablespoons instead of teaspoons and might try garlic or oregano to help lift it.This dish has definite possibilities though.,neutral
I tried this recipe due to all of the overwhelming good response.I cooked this chicken exactly as instructed (I used half of the required crackers) and I must say that it was the worst chicken I have ever eaten.The crust was sweet and breaded.I had to peel off the crust to halfway enjoy the actual meat.I will never cook it nor recommend it to anyone.,negative
These were wonderful and are a perfect side for macaroni and cheese.,neutral
"Tasty and simple chicken recipe. I used non-fat yogurt and used cooking spray instead of butter to lower the calorie content. I also used the broiler for the last two minutes of cooking, which toasted the sesame seeds and made the recipe even better. Would definitely make again, but might add herbs (eg. tarragon) or dijon mustard for more flavour.",neutral
I think I cooked it too long.Otherwise the sauce was great.The aroma while it was cooking was awesome.Otherwise due to not paying close enough attention the chicken was a little dry.,neutral
"Well, this was an interesting experience!!I was intrigued by the recipe, but found it to be far more labor-intensive than the end result warranted.While the taste of this dish was quite good- I AM sitting here stuffed to the gills as I type this!- it came out kind of funny looking, and not impressive as I had hopped.View a picture of it here:[url=http://www.pbase.com/image/1031595]Banana Stuffed French Toast[/url].I didn't submit it under the recipe itself because I'm not quite certain that this is the way it is 'supposed' to look.All in all, a tasty dish!But the final appearance, a kitchen stacked with dishes, and far more then 20 minutes prep/cook time made this only a three-star meal.",neutral

"Tasty for family style fare, but not muscular enough for Barb and me, even though I added a tps of dried red chili flakes.",neutral
Some ingredent must have been left out.I followed directions exactly and the sauce is runny as water.Taste like pure lemon juice. Not edible the way it is written.,negative
"Based on taste, this rates higher than a 3, but based on presentation it rates low, so I've settled on a 3-star rating; I would give 3-1/2 if I could. I required an extra 1/2 cup bread crumbs to get a firmer mixture -- no big deal -- and used slightly less worcestershire. Also, Rotel is not available in Canada so I substituted a tinned tomato mixture that's not as spicy. I rolled this up tight and it looked beautiful going into the oven. But despite it being tight with the sides pinched and sealed, some cheese leaked out. Even so, it was nicely browned and I thought I would get nice slices, but as I cut into it it just fell apart wherever there was cheese. I had let it sit for a few minutes before cutting, too. So I had hunks of meatloaf with a cheese edging. It looked sloppy on the serving platter, but had a nice taste. I'm sure it will make for good sandwiches tomorrow.",neutral
"It was a good dish, but like it did lack some flavour for my personal taste.Moist meatballs though!",neutral
"It wasn't as tasty as I'd expected it to be.However, if you reduce the flour by half (or double the spices) and added more spices, such as parsley flakes, rosemary or whatever you prefer, it could be improved.",neutral

"Fantastic.New, (at least for me) exotic in its way.Proofthat the right combination of bland and inexpensive can indeed make an eating event.I did find that 2 cups water to 1/3 cup groats wastoo much, at least for this altitude (5,400 ft.)

"The taste of these potatoes was milder than I expected.It took a lot longer to cook than the amount indicated.After 1 1/2 hours in the oven, I popped the dish in the microwave for a few minutes to get the potatoes soft enough for our liking.My husband did not care for these at all, but my daughter enjoyed them.I would add lemon zest to punch up the lemon flavor a bit and perhaps some lemon pepper seasoning.These needed quite a bit of seasoning.A good recipe, but not for all tastes.",neutral
Reminds me of liquid medication that my mother had to force me to take.,negative
"My family had mixed reviews with this recipe.My husband and I thought it was good, but not stellar.It took closer to an hour for the chicken to cook through - and I used skinless boneless breasts.I did not care for the large amount of oil the chicken sits in while roasting - it added fat and calories, but not as much flavor as I expected.If I made this again, I would not use as much oil.",neutral
"The first time I made it, I followed your instructions and cooked the oatmeal in the microwave, but it was a bit too gooey and heavy for my liking. The second time, I used quick-cooking oats, cereal, a sprinkling of raisins and almonds and COLD milk, and it was much nicer that way.",neutral
"Simple enough recipe to make, and it tasted ok but not great. It seems to be missing something, but I can't put my finger on what that is.",neutral
As a true Brit this is not an authentic recipe. Using only ground raw meat (ham burger) does not give it the texture and taste this truly unique dish deserves. Look in any old cookbook and you will see it should be made with either cold roast beef or mutton and left over gravy.,negative

"While the meat came out VERY moist, I found that doubling the sauce still wasn't enough; perhaps garlic the next time, and a bit more Worchesteshire sauce to lemon.",neutral
"This was good, but a little salty.I would suggest using low sodium canned soups.I also added a can of corn for some color.",neutral
This dish was tasty but I found that it didn't have a lot of sauce - which made it rather dry for my tastes.Next time I'll add more cream or milk.,neutral

I made it ""full-fat"", with regular evaporated milk and American cheese slices.I also used canned, sliced mushrooms instead of fresh (what can I say, I needed to save some time).The recipe has good flavor and texture, is easy and quick to make.I used the microwave to precook my spinach.The only problem I had with the recipe is that the directions don't say when to add the evaporated milk.So I added it, a little at a time, as I melted the cheese.It seemed the right thing to do.",neutral
"There was absolutely nothing creamy about this casserole.It was crunchy and dry.I followed the recipe perfectly.I've read over it several times just to be sure.It was such a disaster that I had to order pizza for our guests.It was so embarrasing.I think that it needs more cream cheese, possibly and less chips.Good luck to the rest of you that try it.",negative
"I tried this recipe lastnight and although it sounded good, I could not get the cornflake crumbs to stick to the onions. After I tried dipping them in egg and had no success I tried milk and still couldnt get them to stick. Wasnt a success at all.",negative
"My fiancee thought this slaw was incredible!I, on the other hand, found it to be a bit too oily tasting.His only suggestion was that I should have made it several hours earlier, to give the flavors time to marinate.While it definately had a good flavor, I could only taste a heavy, sesame-drenched palate coming through. Good stuff!While I will definately make this again, I will adjust the seasonings, and perhaps prep time, a bit.Thank you!",neutral
"I loved these. My fiancee didn't particularly care for them at all.He really does have the more discriminating palate, though if I could have, i would have voted this recipe at least a three-and-a-half.The flavor of the sauce, in my opinion, was perfectly biting and very complementary to the chosen Mandarin-Style Steak, Asian Slaw, and Spicy Cucumbers.So, if you enjoy the starchy-side of life, and a bit of spice as well:these noodles will tantalize!If you are not a fan of starch, and, well, have a more discriminating palate than I, you may not enjoy these quite as much.Soba noodles, apparently, are a matter of choice.",neutral
"The topping in this dessert is delicious, although we found the base very 'stodgy' and dry I wonder if maybe more than the 1/2 cup milk used should actually be 1 cup?I will make this again but use more milk, we all loved the topping.",neutral
"If I may say so, I had begun to make this when I realised I didnt have curry powder at home.So, back home in India, if we dont have curry powder, we use a combo of red chilli powder, turmeric powder, corriander powder and garam masala powder. I did just thatI used 3/4 tsp. red chilli powder, 1 tsp. turmeric powder, 1 tsp. each of garam masala and corriander powder. It was a nice dish, I must also mention that it was indeed ""Light"". I used 1 1/2 fresh tomatoes instead of 1/2. And yes, 1 tsp. salt( was perfect for the 2 cups cauliflower, IMHO). Thank you for a nice calorie wise dish",neutral
"Recipenut, these tasted great in the end!!But I had a terrible time rolling the crescent dinner rolls, they were so elastic, they kept snapping back, so we ended up with half crust and half not. the cheese sauce turned out very tasty but not thick enough, consequently the middle part never did get cooked, which didn't stop us from eating it.So there is half of it left, we are hoping it will taste as good cold and will have thickened some, if not I will sprinkle some feta and sundried tomato on top and stick it in the oven again.Great taste, but the recipe just didn't work.",neutral
"Well, I didn't have quite the same reaction about this recipe.I found the muffins to be quite bland and flavourless.They were not very moist - rather dry in my opinion.I used the canned crushed pineapple as stated in the recipe.Will not make this again.",negative
"Did not have golden onion soup mix so tried herb and garlic (Lipton).I loved the flavor of the mustard - used honey mustard - and butter for the sandwich spread.However, I used regular white sandwich bread and when I dipped (fairly quickly) it got soaked all the way through.In cooking, perhaps the heat was too high but the inside of the bread (next to the ham and cheese) was still soggy.I'll try cooking slower over lower heat next time.Great taste if not a little drippy.",neutral
"this was very good, my mistake was the french bread I used was to soft and it made it mushy, BUT the cream cheese spread you make for this was awsome! it would be good to make and put on bagels. but over all this was very good and I think I will make it again but with a dince type of bread.",neutral
"I made this last night, it was good but needed more lemon and less crust! next time I will double the lemon mix. and I added powdered sugar on top.",neutral
"I made this the night before and served it cold.I thought the flavors were a little off, maybe it was the combo of the dijon mustard and red wine vinegar.It might have been better served hot.I noticed my dinner guests didn't help take second helpings.If I make this again, next time I will try to serve it hot.",neutral
I am sorry to say that this chicken was fairly bland – I don’t believe I’ll be making it again anytime soon.,neutral
"Just didn't do it for me. I take cakes into work once a week and have a reputation of being a pretty good cook. I through it in the bin. I didn't like the texture, taste wasn't out there. Maybe, I did something wrong.",neutral
This was an easy recipe to make. But it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I used frozen broccoli and I think fresh would be better. And I wish I had used parmesan instead of cheddar.I think I will try again.,neutral
"Made this recipe last night.I liked the flavor and the recipe was easy.It's typical Campbell's...you know it's been tested enough that it should come out like you'd expect).I didn't have time to slightly freeze my top sirloin, so I didn't get the strips quite as thin as I'd like (for tenderness).My husband didn't offer much in the way of opinion last night, but refused to eat it today as leftovers.I made him a grilled cheese sandwich while I had this again.It was still OK, but not fantastic.A good, basic dish.",neutral
"Gibberish, lassie, gibberish.",neutral
I think you could get about 12 servings from this recipe.You could not tell there was any maple syrup in it.Good taste.Fixed this on 2-10-02 Worldwide Recipezaar Day.,neutral
"I substituted margerine and only used half what was called for and that worked out fine. As far as the marjoram...I dug up some herbes fines and noticed it contained both thyme and marjoram, so, I used it. It was....okay....I wouldn't use that particular herb again. I would perhaps stick to salt and pepper or perhaps some garlic. I found it a little too herby! Otherwise, it was very moist, tender, and easy to prepare.",neutral
"The whole family agreed that the breading or coating on the chicken was very good and the chicken was very tender. However, all four of us agreed that this is way too greasy. I will make this again, but I will just spray a pan with non-stick coating and bake without any butter at all. Thanks for the recipe!",neutral
"These muffins were a little too moist for my liking.They were tasty, but next time I will add more orange rind for extra flavour.I found that my batch yielded 16 muffins.",neutral
Good but needs more flavor.,neutral
This recipe called out for ginger.Other Jamacian sweet potato appetizer recipes that I saw did have ginger.Too many calories so I baked them as suggested but without brushing with oil.The mojito sauce was essential.Everyone said that they were good but there were a few left.,neutral
"Hard to give a mediocre rating to anything cooked in a crockpot, but this recipe was ""just OK"" to my family.The peppers cooked so long that they were mushy and had a bitter taste to them--perhaps I did something wrong but I wasn't all that impressed.",neutral
"Tasted pretty good, very quick and healthy as Erin said!However, you should probably use large broccoli florets and very wide strips of red pepper, as the vegetables get done very quickly.Also, had a hard time finding dark sesame oil, but found olive or vegetable oil can be substituted.",neutral
"This was not a bad recipe, I just don't think the taste suited me. My husband liked the meal. I felt like the recipe made a larger quantity of meatballs than we needed, so I gave the leftovers to my neighbors. They loved the meal as well. I guess it was just me who didn't like them!",neutral
"My family didn't really like this recipe, although I did.My husband said he could never get past the ""dilly"" flavor.Leftover casserole seemed sort of dry the next day, but I think if I had added a little mayo or sour cream it would have worked out better.",neutral
"Maybe I was expecting too much from all the great reviews but I found nothing about this chicken to really crow about...The pepsi sauce was little more than slightly sweetened water and although it did not taste bad, I was disappointed...Guess I was expecting something that would reach out and slap your taste-buds, not tickle them...",neutral
Wasn't as good as I thought it would be.MUST be eaten within 1 day of making or the crust goes soggy. Also you may want to just make regular cream puffs as the crust is really much thicker than it should be for a cream puff.,neutral
"I made these last night and I was extremely disappointed, I don't know if it was something I did, I don;t ususally have a problem with biscuits, but these were so salty, we couldn't even choke them down, maybe it should say to use unsalted butter? They didn't rise at all either, they were more like cookies? Any tips to help me, because these sound like they could be very good?",negative
I cut down on most ingredients to make it serve 4.Was a nice potato dish but will cut down on the sugar even more next time.Thanks for posting. ,neutral
"This was good but we did not care for the Catsup.So I WILL make again and try using all tomato sauce, or at least a 3:1 ratio.",neutral
"I tried this recipe and frankly it would have been better to be more specific with the amounts of ingredients as far as proportions. Anyone can write ""a little of this, a little of that"", but to know what one is really doing, they must be able to tell the reader how much of each of the spices. I used my own amounts and luckily I did not waste my ingredients, but the sauce would not have tasted good without being jazzed up a bit.",negative
"I thought this might be one of those recipes that sounds very strange but actually might be delicious, but I was wrong. They did not taste bad - just weird. Now I know why our local bakery does not sell them.",neutral
"Ok this tasted great, i cut off the tops and dropped in a dollop of whipped cream and jam.I had a really difficult time with the recipe though.I couldnt get the ingredients to combine (my mixer broke) and then they overflowed in a really peculiar way.They looked like slugs escaping from the tin.I had to add some milk with the flour to combine.Maybe I was just having a bad day.Note on the good side, these arent too sweet and very moist.",neutral
"Thought it would have better if the salsa and some cheese were mixed with the meat before baking.The bottom was soggy, the meat dry with a layer of salsa and cheese on the top.Could have made a much tastier dish with my pound of hamburger.",neutral
"This was a good recipe, but the amount of marmalade was a bit overpowering for our tastes. I adore marmalade, so I was very surprised that we didn't care for the taste as much as expected.The bread part was yummy, but the filling tasted a little sour. The batter was tasty however, and the cooking method worked out nicely. The French Toast looked lovely on the plate.I would use this method again, but I would select different filling ingredients.",neutral
Very bland.Didn't care for the combination of chicken with boiled egg.The egg taste was too overpowering--made the whole dish taste more like egg salad than chicken anything.,neutral
Chicken was moist but not much flavor.I only used half the crackers and butter spray for all of the butter.I will try again but add some spices to give it more flavor.,neutral
Expected more zip from the sour cream.No thrill for the calorie count.,neutral
This might be easy but it's not very good. Ragu has nothing to worry about.,negative

"My kids gave it 1 thumb up, said they'd like it as a once a month thing. I think I'll try some Rotel in it next time to kick it up a notch.....",neutral
"Okay, I think this recipe had great potential, but I tried it twice and it was not very cooperative.The sauce was great, very nice flavor, but with only 4 cups of rice, it was swimming in the sauce.The first time I made it I used 4 cups + 2 additional cups or rice, not all the way cold, but cooled down.I also only used 1/2 cup of water.I removed about 3/4 c of liquid from this mixture with a spoon in attempt to get them to stick together.The second time, I cooled the rice all the way down in the fridege, used less water and a little more peanut butter and honey.Still not sticking together well.I used probably 1/2 c of peanut butter which is probably not the intended flavor, but it was okay.On the 2nd batch, I used only 1/2 tsp of Cayenne.I used medium grained rice.I tried this twice because I wanted this to work, it was for a party I was having and I ended up not serving them, let my fiance eat them instead.",neutral
I think it left the pork way to dry and the sweet potatoes not sweet. The BBQ pork sandwich was awsome the next night.,negative
"I liked this one, but wish I had put in more bacon and more cream (I added just a little)! When served with freshly grated parmesan cheese, it was wonderful. I thought it would also be good with a little broccoli in it! I'll try that next time.",neutral
"I felt this would have been a wonderful side dish, rather than a main course. It was tasty, but probably a bit of an acquired taste. I added a little more garlic to the recipe, and found that it did need a little more salt even after all I had put into the cooking phase. If you really like eggplant, you'll love this! It would be really cute if you had smaller eggplants in which to put the stuffing. Thanks!",negative
"These were very bland and dry.There was not very much ""zip"" to them and the moistness just wasn't there.This is not something I will try again.",negative

"This was so pretty on the plate, but I couldnt convince anyone to eat much of it. They all politely sais that's nice, but only ate a few spoonfuls.If you are serving to a more openminded group this recipe is great.Nothing went wrong until I served it.Note on ingredients, I couldn't get Saffron but it still worked fine.",neutral
I found this recipe quick and easy to prepare and to bake it tastes good too! yummy!,neutral
"I'm giving this dish three stars because although it was good, in my opinion it can be improved upon.After mixing the ingredients in the crockpot, I found it to be rather bland.I ended up adding more salt, chili powder and paprika, and to increase the flavor I also added garlic powder and cayenne pepper.Next time I will add more tomato paste also because it was a little on the runny side.But altogether, not a bad dish and an easy idea for dinner.",neutral
"I dont know if I did something wrong with this recipe or what happened, but my sauce was watery. Maybe use more cheese and it would be better. The seasonings were nice together..but my sauce turned out watery!?",neutral
"This is not bad.I think if I made it again, I would skip the chicken broth all together and just just use 3 cups of milk.(Just a straight white sauce).I wasn't too thrilled with the taste of the sauce.I used ""express"" lasagna noodles (ones that you don't have to pre-boil), and it didn't work that well in this recipe.It made the noodles very tough - hard to even cut!Sassy.",neutral
"I thought it was very good, but not ""to die for"".I cut way back on the butter, used fat-free sour cream and a mixture of saltines and ritz crackers.I will make it again.",neutral
"This tasted allright, but my loaf did not turn out as a regular size loaf.I followed the instructions you gave but my loaf looked more like a half a loaf.Next time I think I'll use the ""bread dough"" and finish it in the oven.",neutral
This wa real simple and my family liked the taste. I added more honey and made it sweeter.,neutral
This recipe cries out for ham.Either some diced ham in the casserole or to be served with either a baked ham or fried ham steak with Lima beans and some cornbread.I halved the recipe to serve 4 and cooked an extra long time at a lower temperature after the orginal baking time to make an extra crispy crust on top.,neutral
"I made this last evening and everyone loved it!In addition to the chicken, I added 1/2 pound ofsweet italian sausage as I have BIG MEATEATERS to feed...it was a hit!This is a fast and foolproof recipe I recommend highly. . . thanks ",neutral

"We liked the basic recipe, but I added some chili powder and cumin to the meat for a bit more southwestern flavor.",neutral
"I'm sorry, but this dish was lacking in flavour and spice and was rather bland. I'm someone who dislikes spicy food, but even I had to sprinkle some extra pepper on my plate, but that didn't help much either.

"I had to join the crowd and find out what all the fuss was about.This recipe was a disappointment.Easy to make, but very bland.No WOW factor at all.",neutral
Very tender roast with nice flavor combination.I used about a 2 1/2 pound boneless roast and cooked it on low for about 10 hours.I didn't have any apricot nectar so I used apple juice and peach jam instead of marmalade.I also used a bit more corn starch as my family likes a thicker gravy. I will make it again soon.,neutral
"This recipe is ok, it's a little on the thick side. I had it with rice, it would probably taste better with noodles, though.",neutral
"This is not a true tarte au sucre. Maple extract should never, ever be used, not should nutmeg.The flour is unnecessary and the cooking temperature is too low. there is an execellent Tarte au sucre recipe in the recipezaar files and I suggest that those interested should try it.",negative
"This recipe is allright upto the first 10 steps.Well, after these were baked for 10 minutes, when I opened the oven door, what I saw was that the cookies were floating in a pool of butter(the butter of the cookies itself), I did not grease the cookie sheet like you said. I was furious. Just closed the oven door, leaving the cookies inside. After 50 minutes when I opened it, lo and behold, I saw that the cookies were perfectly done! What a surprise! Then, I transferred them onto a plate and allowed to cool completely, after which, I have stored them in an airtight container to serve as n when desired. Thanks, its a tasty cookie, but these comments would help everyone trying this in future.",neutral

"Anu, it was nice! Good actually because I used red lentils and it was so easy to digest, also I added 1/2 lime juice, 4 tbsp and 1 tsp of ginger-garlic paste, 1 tsp red chilli powder and garnished with my favourite , cilantro!Enjoyed it with roti last night!Thanks!",neutral
This is a very tasty salad...the only problem is that it won't slice nice for serving.Am I doing something wrong?,neutral
I was told years ago by a chef that calamari should be fried for no longer than 2 minutes or to cook as in sauces and soups to cook for at least 2 hours.,neutral
This was okay. But I think marinating in fat free italian dressing can give the same effect with less effort.,neutral
"This was nice to make ahead,and then bake later.I added garlic,and used Italian style stewed tomatoes.It was very tasty.It would be very good to take to a potluck.",neutral
"This was nice, but a tad too garlicky for me. I used yellow lentils, and had this with fresh bread for a satisfying lunch. Next time I'll try this with onions instead of garlic.",neutral
"Tasty, simple and very easy. I liked the addition of the banana, used pineapple pieces, make sure you drain them, lots of liquid in this dish and I cut back by 1/4 cup.",neutral
"The chicken was very tender but the flavour just wasn't what we thought it would be.I love balsamic vinegar, but I think I woul cut down the amount next time.It wasn't our taste but it was extremely tender and juicy.",neutral
The combination of pickeled peppers and vinegar were too much for me--left a strong after taste. I would prefer regular jalapenos and cut the vinegar out. Cilantro would be a good addition.,neutral
I do a lot of baking and this just didn't impress me or the people I work with.,neutral
This was very good. I used a mixture of medium cheddar and monterey jack cheese.,neutral

I tried it and found it a failure!Does need an egg or something to hold it together.It turned out very fry and crumbly.I re-crumbled what I produced and made you recipe for oatmeal bars ( the one with chocolate and rasins. I adjusted the sugar and butter (1/2 cup instead of 1). It turned out very edible.,negative
"Tom, my man - I have several things to say:(1) Your recipe has some shortcomings - (a) you don't say how long to bake them (b) you don't say how thick they should be (c) you don't list a gas oven temperature(2) You must have been making some TINY cookies to get 60 of them out of these ingredients!(3) They were overlapping one another when they were done - you should state how far apart they should be while in the oven. I was not aware that they would expand.Despite all of that, and with some pure guesswork on my part, they tasted wonderful. I would have given you 5 stars, but you made me do too much thinking and guessing, so I kept a couple of the stars for myself!",neutral

Perhaps a little more help on the sauce part.That's a pretty vague description there.I'm cooking impared so I need a little help.,neutral
I made this dish using the microwave directions.It was easy and quick.,neutral
Good but I like the meat loaf recipe off of the oatmeal box better.,neutral
Easy dish to make.Slight orangy flavor in finished dish.Makes lots of sauce for 1 lb. of beef.I think I'd increase that to 2 pounds.,neutral
"Good recipe, although I needed to sprinkle some water over the beans before and while they were cooking in the microwave, and they still shrivelled up a bit. I omitted the garlic, and increased the amount of pepper, and it was still rather mild. Definitely a fast and easy dish, and I'll probably make it again after some tweaking.",neutral
I tried this pie and was very disappointed. It barely covered the bottom of my pie crust and was just a film of something that tasted like melted light brown sugar. I was very disappointed.,negative
My gosh.Look at those nutritional facts.No wonder we're such a fat nation.This recipe is just a bad idea.,negative

"This is something different and quite nice. I cut the chicken into serving size pieces and used fresh orange juice because I had no concentrate. I also added half a red Capsicum (bell pepper), chopped, and some sliced Spring Onion just for a little extra colour and texture. Oh, also I had no pepper flakes so I used Paprika. I received pleasing reviews from my three men for this dish! Thanks Dancer^:o)",neutral
Loved this cheesecake.I didn't have any almond extract (must've used it all up during Christmas baking) so I substituted lemon extract. Gives it a wonderful fresh flavor. I'm looking forward to trying this again with almond extract and other types of flavorings.,neutral

This was not what I expected. The texture was more like a souffle or custard. The only change I made was to use two different kinds of cheddar cheese (half white and half yellow) and 1/8 teasp. dry mustard. Took 55 min. to cook. Flavor was very good but hubby asked me not to make it again because he didn't like the texture.,neutral

It's chemistry!",negative
"I made this last night for dad and myself and we quite enjoyed it. I added a tsp. of salt to the rice while cooking it as well as a 1/4 tsp. of the same to the sauce while making that. I boiled the broccoli in another saucepan until it was tender(did this in order to retain its colour). Then, added the broccoli to the onion-garlic mixture followed by the sauce. While making the sauce I used 1 1/4 cups of water. I garnished the dish with cilantro and served it with rotis as well as with rice.",neutral

"Pretty good, I think I would make it again, especially given extra egg yolks.I didn't have lemon extract, so I substituted some lemon zest and some juice... but I don't think you could taste it really.The cake was a bit less delicate than I would have liked... (definitely sponge-like, as my wife said) maybe I over beat the eggs/sugar?But it was delicious with tea!Used a bundt pan, and, because the recipe called for not greasing the pan, had to soak overnight to clean.",neutral

"Made this for tonight's dinner; was easy to make, colorful, very appealing in appearance.In step 6 you're to top with remaining cheese and salsa.It took me a minute to decide that the remaining cheese was the Monterey Jack, but no additional salsa was called for in the ingredients.Fortunately that wasn't a ""biggie"" as I had plenty of salsa available.DH and I decided that using the salsa as a sauce base was not our ""cup of tequila"", so I'll use this basic recipe and improvise with a taco sauce next time.The recipe has definite merits and is worth trying.I'll be interested in what other raters have to say.Maybe someone with lots of enchilada experience can try it and let us know.",neutral
Way to spicey (Hot) Would have been really good if I cut the cumin and cayenne to half or less than recomended. Had to throw it down the drain.,negative
I used a 6lb boneless beef and it was cooked when I go up in the morning.And yes I cooked it on LOW.Tasted nice but very disappointed that it was cooked 10hrs before it was needed.,negative
"Tastes pretty good, but the prep time is really underestimated. Figure the full 50 minutes to get all of the slicing, chopping, browning and cooking done; then yes, about 10 minutes to assemble it. Also, 25 minutes isn't really long enough for baking, given the bulk of it and the fact that you need to be sure that the egg mixture cooks thoroughly. I baked it for 35 minutes, and it could have used 10 more to have the egg mixture really set. As to the ingredient measurements, I assumed that 1 qt. of zucchini was about 4 cups; to balance the amounts of the other ingredients, I wound up using about 5 cups.",neutral

"Baking the Lumpia Rolls was good. But the 8 cloves of garlic was too much. I cut it to 3 cloves and still very strong on the garlic. Next time will cut to 1 clove for this recipe.I love garlic but not to overpower the taste of the lumpia. I use 1 large carrot to give it some sweetness. The sauce using 1/4 cup of brown sugar was too sweet. So I cut the sugar down to 1 tablespoons and used 4 tablespoon rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons of soy sauce.4 tablespoons of water.This will be tandy and sweet. Been making egg rolls for 40 years.This sauce will not overpower the Lumpia just give it the right flavor to enjoy.",negative
"These cookies came out very ""cakey"" (soft and dry). The honey flavor is good but overall the cookies were too bland and dry for my taste.

"I thought these sounded wonderful... maybe I didn't bake them long enough, though I kept 'em in the oven for 30 minutes.They were too much like eating a thick bowl of oatmeal.While not necessarily a bad thing, it wasn't what I expected from these... I think I was missing the crunch!They tasted okay... perhaps just not the bar cookie that I expected.Thank you anyways!",neutral
"Admittedly, I don't have a stand up mixer, so my kitchen sort of looked like I Love Lucy last night. I decided to put everything in my bread machine. It worked, but I wish I would have looked more carefully at the serving size. Next time I'll cut the recipe in half. But it was tasty and it sure smelled good.",neutral
"This was pretty good although I used Italian Spice rather than the basil and oregano. I also made Steve Sickenberger's pizza dough (a whole lot of it) #8497. I diced up a tomato as well as some black olives. And added a little garlic. Like I said, it was pretty good.",neutral
"The sauce was much too thick - I question if the ingredient amounts are correct. I think these would benefit from a little spice, because they are fairly bland and not spectacular by any means.",neutral

"I hate to mark low, but the mustard in this was very over powering. I halved the amount for 4 breasts, and I wish I had just put a smear on each one. I love mustard, but it really did dominate. I plan to make this again, but I think I will mix 2tbsp mustard and 2 tbsp mayonaisse to tone it down. I also cooked the breasts for 30 minutes total, and they were cooked to perfection (in my oven).

"This was one of my Mom's favorites!Nice to see it again.I have made it a little differently, layering lettuce, green pepper, onion, celery, and then peas.The peas should be last because they help to ""seal"" off the lettuce from the dressing.I then ""frosted it with Hellman's mayonnaise mixed with about 1 TBS. sugar.Then top with grated cheddar cheese and the bacon on top.Leftovers will keep in the frig for a day or two.",neutral
"These are not the best blueberry muffins in the world.I was pretty disappointed.They were extremely heavy (dense) and very bland.I have to think that maybe the flour measurement is incorrect.5 1/4 cups is an awful lot.The batter was very thick, almost like dough.Unless someone corrects the amount of flour, I suggest looking elsewhere for the ""best blueberry muffins in the world.""",negative

I made this punch for a baby shower and it was just too tart for most of the guests taste.I put 46 oz of pineapple juice in it so that may be part of the reason.I didn't find any 6 oz containers and since all I found was 46 I thought there may have been a typo in the recipe.,neutral
A nice soft cookie but nothing super special.,neutral
"I put the meatloaf mixture in my glass meatloaf pan and used hamburger (17% fat)instead of ground sirloin. I'll use the ground sirloin next time because I had to drain the fat off several times during the cooking process.The bell pepper gave the meatloaf good flavor, but I think next time I might microwave the pepper to cook it more.I like my veges crunchy, but the pepper was a little too underdone for my taste.Lastly, I'm not a ketchup fan, so would reduce the amount poured on top, maybe by half.I really liked how quickly I could get this into the oven!I will prepare this again, but with a few changes. After making the recipe changes to our taste, I think I would rate this recipe higher. Thanks alot!",neutral
"I used nofat sour cream and 1 small can of condensed cream of mushroom soup instead.I think that I'll try cheese or celery, or chicken soup next time.

"Recipe starts with a 5-star rating. Loses 1/2 star for not showing prep/cooking time and 1/2 star for not indicating servings. Nutrition Facts are way out of whack because of chef's failure to provide necessary information - minus another 1/2 star. Following chef's directions, enchilada sauce was way too thin, watery, and bland. I had to add 6 oz. tomato paste, lots more cumin and chili powder, and had to double the simmering time in order to achieve a ""saucy"" consistency - minus 1 more star. The end result was enchiladas that were quite good (I did broil them at the latter stage of cooking, to bubble and crisp some of the cheese). That being the saving grace, I'll bump my 2.5 star rating up to 3 stars.",neutral

"Very nice dish, Lennie, but I wasn't totally blown away by the taste, and I DO like bell peppers!  I thought the combination of honey, vinegar and ginger would give it a unique taste, but the honey and ginger were virtually imperceptible; the vinegar was kinda overbearing! I had to make do with dried oregano, which worked well enough, I think. Also, since bell pepper sizes can vary greatly, it would help if the recipe mentioned how much sliced bell peppers there should be in all (in cups or ounces), because I ended up with really small servings. I used all green bell peppers, since that's all we get here, but I bet using red and orange would make for an awesome presentation!",neutral

"Ok, the brown sugar stubbornly refused to melt! I used 1/4 cup water in the beginning, which seemed more than enough, and followed all the instructions. After chilling, I was left with fudge that really tasted fantastic, but was, nevertheless, too 'crunchy' because of all the undissolved sugar. So I remelted the whole thing in a double-boiler a second time, adding 1 tablespoon of water, in the hope that the sugar would melt. It didn't, so I left it as it was. The combination of ingredients is just right, and it tastes great, except for the crunchy sugar. Next time I'll try powdering the brown sugar as well.",neutral
These were not my favorite....maybe I didn't add enough orange rind or something.,neutral
"This recipe sounded so good, but we ended up just tossing it out and going out for fast food. I followed the recipe as is, but my rice never seemed to stop being crunchy. I tried adding more water, a can of tomato soup, anything to give it more liquid to cook the rice, but to no avail. It ended up cooking for over an hour and by then the cabbage was unrecognizable. If I were to attempt this recipe again I would use either cooked rice or instant and save the cabbage until the last 10 minutes or so.",negative
"We didn't have a pan large enough to hold all the ingredients so ended up browning the chicken and then putting everything into a baking dish and putting in the oven to finish cooking. The sauce ended up a little watery, but I think I could have added the rice and set the whole thing to bake as a cassarole. Had very good flavor and was easy to make.",neutral

If anyone is keeping an eye on their caloric intake and/or cholesterol and saturated fats, by all means opt for reduced fat sour cream and much, much less butter/margarine (try coating the pan with cooking spray, then drizzle the melted butter on top).

The taste was good, but they spread a lot on the baking sheet and I couldn't get them to come off the sheet easily, no matter how much I greased it.

So I'm assuming everyone that loved this, must have drained it first? Ours was scarey.",negative
"I was a little disappointed with this recipe.It was very easy to prepare and the meat was very tender, but I didn't find the flavor anything special.I think I would have gotten the same results by simply boiling the ribs then covering them with bbq sauce and simmering them for awhile without all the extra ingredients.I thought because it had pop that they would be sweet and somewhat sticky, but they weren't at all what I had expected.Unfortunately, probably won't make them again.",neutral

"I had a problem right off with this, which was not the recipeand#8217;s fault; that being that I used ice glazed chicken that had so much water, it tended to stew instead of browning.So I had to drain the chicken twice in the second step. (I used four ¼ lb breasts, and they just about filled the skillet.)Other than that I stayed on recipe.In step 5 when the tomatoes are added and brought to a boil, there was very little if any liquid to boil. There is a certain complexity here that I do not understand: why simmer the wine in step 6 for ten minutes and then add the thyme and basil for another 5 minutes?There were not enough ingredients to warrant 15 minutes of simmering.I would suggest simmering the wine for maybe 6 minutes and adding the thyme and basil just before the chicken is returned.I think this might help articulate the flavors a bit.",neutral
I liked this marinade and will try it again.Less oil tho.It calls for ginger which I didn't have so tried 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice. Ran out of soy sauce at 1/2 cup and cont. to 2/3 with worcestershire sauce.My husband thought the steak had good flavor and so did I.,neutral

"I made this last night.I have 2 complaints.First, the bread stuck.I did not add anything or take anything away from the recipe.I followed it to the letter and I am a very experienced cook.Second, after 1 hour in the oven, the middle was still very raw.I had to bake this for an additional 30 minutes and it still isn't really done.",neutral
I made 2 batches of these and served them at tea time this evening. We enjoyed them. Thanks for the yummy recipe!,neutral
MirjamI like just about all your recipes.This one though just did not do it for me.Maybe I added too much ginger.The soy sauce I used made this really far too salty for my taste.If I play around with it a bit maybe I'll get it more to my taste.,neutral
"A little high in fat for my taste, but good flavor on fish or even salads.",neutral
may i suggest no bannanas. I have tried your wonderful recipe and i think that it is okay. But then i did not add bannanas and it was FANTASTIC. Try it. Its really quite the morcle.,negative
"Got to be honest here - we didn't care too much for this one. This was more like a cake than a cobbler, I thought and unfortunately it was a pretty dry cake. At the very least, it needed more cherry pie filling.",neutral
"Sorry to say, we thought this was not very good. The chicken came out alittle dry and not very flavorful. The sauce was very thin - I had expected it to be thicker. Considering the ingredients, I really expected a much more flavorful dish and the chicken itself was pretty bland. I followed the recipe exactly.",neutral
My family thought this was just ok. Probably would not make it again. I used the fat free miracle whip which could be the reason nobody raved.,neutral
i'm soory but i think your idea is bad 8 against 2 just wins,negative
"Actually, the people that boil the can without opening it first are not idiots but know what they are doing. If you submerge the whole can in water (at least an inch of water above the can) the can will never explode.Instead, you will be able to make the caramel in half the time, since it will be boiled under pressure. In two hours you will have semi-solid spread and in 3.5 a solid dessert.Plus it's easy, no need to open the can, find a foil, measure the water level.Just take the can and boil it.Voila.",neutral

"This is a god recipe, I have a similair one somewhere..not suer about the exact amount of each ingredient, their authentic greek lemon potatoes, I learned from my greek boyfriend's mom.You take lemon juice, add a bit of water,pour over potatoe wedges, add salt and pepper, and a little cinnimon.VERY good Goes good with lamb, or lemon chicken.",neutral
"Cinnamon is a nice flavor addition, but it is a pretty ordinary sort of ""crisp"" topping.Flour is mentioned in the recipe, but not listed in ingreients, so quantity is not known.",neutral
"Pleasant-tasting, but rather bland. To get a real lemony flavor, I'd double the amount of lemon in the cheese mixture, and maybe use a lemon cake mix, rather than yellow. I also thought about making it using the specified amount of lemon and a Betty Crocker chocolate fudge cake mix. It wouldn't exactly be ""lemon"" cheese bars, but I bet it would be good. Also, I wound up baking it in a 9x9 inch pan, because I couldn't imagine how the cheese mixture could spread over 9x13 inches; even in the 9x9 pan, it was fairly thin. Another time, I think I would double the amounts on the ingredients of the cheese mixture and do everything else as specified, including the pan size. If so, it might be necessary to up the second baking time a little to be sure the cheese mixture got cooked through.",neutral
I didn't have sage so I used Durkees chicken and rib grill...it was a success at our pot-luck at work...everyone wants the recipe!,neutral
"While this recipe is easy I found it quite salty,so the next time I prepared it I used half the amount of taco seasoning,added more garlic,chili and cumin powders as well as sliced onions with sweet peppers(these last are found in the grocery freezer section)Try it. The extra few minutes are worth it.",neutral
"I made this using blenderized cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese and added a little fresh chopped parsley. I was Delicious, however it loses flavor if you let it get cold. Parmesan cheese is good topper.",neutral
"This dish was pretty good, but it's a bit heavy.I found it a bit heavy on the sour-cream, too - if I make it again, I'll probably cut the sour-cream by 1/4, and maybe toss in some broccoli florets.",neutral
Made it tonight for dinner. I would suggest you brush the patty with oil/ butter before putting it in the oven to broil(grill). This way it turns out much more softer. I liked the taste of the cumin seeds in it,neutral
We enjoyed this recipe.I was not really sure what temperature to cook the casserole.The oven temperature was not included in the recipe.We did find this to have a bit too much mayonnaise,neutral

"Bought the ingredients and started to make this, got to step #4...wait a minute...WHAT SOUP??? Not on the ingredient list! [editors note: added cream of celery]Substituted jar of Alfredo sauce.

"These are good, but they are not Tootsie Rolls.The real Tootsie Rolls are so hard to chew would pull the fillings out of your teeth.These are soft and delicious.I did miss the ""chew"".I will make these again, but maybe roll them into balls and then dredge in cocoa or powdered sugar.They make a nice treat to put out on the coffee table.",neutral
"These were very easy to make, and made a whole mess of them. They seem to freeze well. I love them, my husband hates them. Thanks for the recipe. I think the crust would taste wonderful with eggs or some other filling for breakfast in it like you get from the freezer section at the grocery store.",neutral
"this could be little better ,the crust comes out thick on one side thin on the other,for me it is just all right.",neutral
"Maybe my orange concentrate was too sweet, but even without adding honey, this smoothie was a tad too sweet for my tastebuds.

i really did not care for them like that other person said i found these to be bland.,negative
"I really wanted to like this, but I guess it just didn't fit my taste.I couldn't even make it through one burger.In addition, even though the outside looked well cooked the inside was pink (probably my fault, but a problem none the less) and I had to finish cooking them in the microwave.",neutral
The cookies were cakey in texture and did not have any cherry flavor.,negative
"Liked the combination of flavors, but the cake turned out WAY too 'dense' and way too sweet for us.Heavier than even carrot cake.",neutral
We did not like the recipe at all.To many breadcrumbs.It sort of made you gag.Wouldn't make it again.,negative
"Thick is definitely accurate.Not bad, but it was a little TOO much for my tastes.It was so thick, it was a little hard to handle without making a mess.Probably would not make again",neutral
"This was pretty good, but I think next time I'll add some brown sugar or something, to ""kick up"" the crust portion a little.The ""filling"" was excellent with a little lemon zest added in.I just think the crust is a little tasteless.A few alterations, and this could make a great, tasty, low-fat new way of enjoying the taste of rhubarb deserts, without a ton of fat.",neutral
"I tried out this recipe and it was shocking.My freinds did not like it I did not like it, it was the worst thing ive tasted for a long time!",negative
"This was nice, but the garlic overpowered the dish. The combination of herbs makes this pleasantly different, and next time, I'll try this with half the amount of garlic. I used 2 teaspoons of dried rosemary, but didn't change anything else.",neutral

"While these muffins were being baked, the whole house smelt like a bakery!!These muffins have been very aptly titled. I made these today and they were really moist, actually, a little bit more than I'd expected. They were enjoyed by all.

"I love jalapeno cheese bread!I added extra jalapenos, used butter instead of vegetable oil, added in a little of the liquid from the canned jalapenos (a couple of tablespoons), added a 1/2 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 tsp cumin (I can never stop fiddling with recipes!).It was quite tasty, but still a little dry.",neutral
"Some people might enjoy this salad, but the dressing was too sweet for my tastes.",neutral
"Not bad, But not the best.Needs more banana.",neutral
"Nice enough, but a bit on the dry side. Tossing the cooked pasta with even one teaspoon of butter or olive oil would've helped, without adding on too many fat calories. A few herbs like basil, oregano and parsley would make this much more flavourful.",neutral
"I'm sure this makes a lovely tasting antipasto, but it can be highly dangerous to can. Antipasto recipes containing olives or seafood are NOT safe for home canning.Seafood and olives are low acid foods and produce botulism. The following excerpt is from the Bernardin Home Canning website: Note:Because antipasto is available commercially, many people believe they can preserve their own recipe at home. Most traditional antipasto recipes cannot be home canned safely in a boiling water bath canner. (However, some can be frozen successfully.) When the recipe adds low acid foods such as tuna (or other canned seafood), olives, mushrooms, vegetables and/or oil– the resulting food mixture needs to be processed at temperatures higher than those that can be reached in a boiling water canner. These higher temperatures are essential to avoid the risk of deadly botulism poisoning. Processing filled jars of homemade antipasto in a pressure canner is unsuccessful because the temperature/time combinations required to eliminate the risk of botulism destroys the integrity of the vegetables resulting in a product that is almost spreadable.",negative

"I added some chopped walnuts for a crunchier texture.Also, just a dab of red pepper flakes.Served it with a fruit compote.",neutral
"A nice tasty soup. In the spirit of full disclosure, I did not add the celery or garlic, because I don't like them; I did use a few dehydrated onions, probably about a quarter of what the recipe called for. Aside from personal preference, the garlic is the ingredient I would most consider leaving out, as it would change the whole character of the soup. Also, I didn't have any vegetable stock, but I did have some canned Swanson's chicken broth. I used half broth and half water so that the flavor wouldn't overpower the peas. Finally, the soup is rather thin. I would probably cut the water/broth to 1 1/2 cups another time.",neutral
"A nice soupy variation on Greek zaziki, but I personally like the original better. Would improve quite a bit with garlic added.",neutral

"These muffins were awful. They reminded me of the the baked goods I TRIED to make when I was five. It seems as if the recipe didn't call for enough things (and no oil) to moisten the muffins.

"Imade these last night for supper.I didnt yield as many as the recipe states, and I had an awful time with the dough.This is probably because I am at sea level and I did need to add a lot of flour.I also by no means am an expert yet as they turned out looking horrible.I suppose the visuals will come with practice.My partner found them soggy and although all of these issues may be rectified it isnt the best recipe Ive tried.",neutral

Was not impressed with this cookie. Not as much peanut butter flavor as I expected and was just not the texture I like in a cookie... too much flour.,neutral
This recipe was very dissapointing. I thought it was way too buttery and greasy. My husband and I took one bite and threw the rest away. PBandJ never tasted so good.,negative
"Gosh, this recipe has about a million reviews already so the rating is really for my version. I did not use anything Steven suggested with the exception of the chicken, parmesan cheese, and the sour cream. I used bread crumbs instead of Ritz, I used salt, pepper, cayenne, dill (wish I hadn't used that) and garlic. I sprayed the pan with Pam, melted 1T butter and mixed that with the left over bread crumbs and poured it over the chicken. It certainly was tender. Will I make it again? Probably not, although I am glad to have tried it.",neutral
This was so refreshing but it really depends on the cantalope for flavor. So be sure the cantalopes are in season befor trying this rcipe.,neutral
"Good, but could benifet from some added spices or vegtables such as garlic or onion.Not having had Armenian food before, maybe this is supposed to be a ""plain"" side dish to other foods.",neutral

"i think that sliced peaches would be very beneficial to an already cooked dish of tapioca [my wife;s favourite] and top it with a nice cream sauce,the rubarb is so very tart it might kill the dessert,banyway it is omly a suggestion thank you",neutral
"These are okay but I feel that something is still missing in ingredients as they are quite bland.It took me approximately 45-50 minutes to make the complete taco from scratch; meat, grated cheese, shredded lettuce, etc.They were fairly crispy in texture but I am wondering if maybe they could get a little crispier with the addition of another ingredient and I think a little salt should be added also to help with flavor?I am very excited to find a taco shell recipe to use on a regular basis and I hope to read more comments on how to improve on this one because I think it's real close to what I'm looking for.Lorna",neutral
This is hardly anything worth trying.,negative
A nice light 'punch' but not a traditional Spanish version. I have posted my own recipe which has a bit more...how do you say?? Vavooom!!,neutral
Technical Point !!Tapas actually translates to 'covers'. It originated by some bright spark deciding that a good way of keeping the flies out of the sherry was to cover the copa (cup) with a thin slice of bread. Someone else decide it was a waste to throw the bread away afterwards and put toppings on the bread to be eaten after the drink. And so - TAPAS !!,neutral
"This recipe was delicious.I left out the chopped lettuce and just added another bag of baby spinach, that way I didn't have to cut the spinach up.I also left out the peas and added mushrooms instead.I put a little tobassco in the dressing to kick it up. Everything soaked up the dressing and it was delicious.Only 3 stars cause I had to doctor it up myself.",neutral

"This was a pretty good little casserole. Next time, I am going to try adding more veggies, maybe somemushrooms, etc. I added a little onion, which tasted good. Thanks for posting!",neutral
"This is nice, but a bit plain. I seasoned it with a bit of salt and pepper at the end. I'm sure it would be a lot more flavourful with some sauteed or roasted bell peppers. Instead of using boiling water, I added plain water, brought it to a boil, added the couscous, stirred once, switched off the burner, covered tighly, and let it sit undisturbed for 5 minutes. It works every time, and the couscous is done just right!",neutral
It was real easy to make and real easy to cook.I recommend to other people because the tastewas real meaty and very cheesy also it fills upyour stomach.,neutral

"I made this without the butter and used no-fat sour cream. This probably reduced the yumminess factor, but the chicken was very moist and delicious. I used my own bread crumbs, and added cayenne, garlic salt, and pepper to the sour cream. It was not as crispy as it would have been with the butter, but overall. Very tasty.",neutral

The Glaze is a plus but I don't think anyone would eat a coffee bar with raisins in it! Scandalous!!,neutral
"Tried this, needs more flavor. Actually done in 1 hour. Very easy and quick to put together. A little disappointed, but it was good. I will add more salt and more buter next time. But hey, my husband had 3 helpings, so don't go by me.Myrna",neutral
Sounds Great But so high in fat. also try chopped califorina green chilies mixed in with the chicken for added flavor.,neutral
"The family thought that the taste of the crackers was overpowering in this recipe.For the kids, this was a good thing, the adults didn't care for it.Also - might suggest that some salt and pepper wouldn't hurt.",neutral
This is definitely a traditional recipe. I think some chopped parsely goes well in the meat mixture. What sort of pie is it called if the base is pastry? Is it a potato pie? I can't remember. Both are good.,neutral
"This is pretty good. I did grease the pan, but the crust was very hard to get out. Next time I would line the pan with foil instead. Also, when I took it out of the oven there was a big pool of liquid in the middle so I drained it out and put it back in the oven. Then it was hard to cut out because the topping didn't stay on top of the crust. Sure, this dessert is not the best structually, but it is yummy! I just ate right out of the pan with a spoon.",neutral
"Tried these for the 1st time and was sorry I didn't read all the previous comments...maybe had I defrosted the potatoes first they would have been crispier.Taste was good but not ""to die for"" ... I eliminated the melted margarine and used shallots ... it was good and I'd make it again using some of the comments posted for the best results.",neutral
"I used this to marinade beef for shishkabob. It had a good taste but it wasn't near as spicy as It thought it would be. And I used hot mustard, not regular. The only thing different I did was to double the recipe, but doubled it exactly. It was good, like I said, but needs to be kicked up some way, I think.",neutral
I found it to be a lot of work and high in fat.The taste was all right.,neutral
"I hate to throw water on the fire, but this just wasn't our cup of tea. There is SO much mayonnaise (and, admittedly, I used Hellman's/Best Foods, which is very rich) and then the added fat from the cheese, it was just too much. The flavor was good, though - how can you miss with sweet onions? Perhaps this would be much better with lowfat mayo, but I won't make it again to try.",neutral
"Oh, dear. I liked the intro also, and wish I liked the recipe as much. I think the problem was in the directions—maybe another shibboleth for us experienced cooks. I drained the zucchini in a colander after cooking, then returned them to the pan and mashed them, and added the rest of the ingredients. (The directions didn't say what to do with the margarine, but I melted it, which seemed reasonable.) Unfortunately, ""fluffy"" isn't how I'd describe the result—""mooshy"" or ""gloppy"" would be. I think what she meant by ""drain and mash"" was ""drain and mash in a colander, pressing every bit of liquid out."" That would leave you throwing a good bit of your zucchini down the drain, but would probably make it solid enough to bake up ""fluffy."" It would also give a boost to the cheese; one cup of sharp cheddar hardly made any impression at all on the volume of zucchini I had left after just draining.",neutral

"I made this for 2 of us, so working on the carrots in the recipe I would have scaled it back to 5. I actually used 1 eachfor the 2 of us (which was plenty), left the horseradish and onion at the original teaspoon each, used 1/4 cup of Mayo and about 2 tablespoons of cheese. It tasted fine, but I think the original measurements might be a little out of whack. The mayo mix gets a bit of a curdled looking when you serve it too.",neutral

It reminded me a lot of beef stew made with ground beef, and since I truly dislike beef stew, that's probably why I didn't care for this.

I made this last night for my grand-kids and they didn't like it at all! Tasteless!May-be some salt or seasoning of some kind.,negative
I had trouble getting the meringue to come to a stiff peak. I finally had to put it onto my mixer and beat it at high speed for about 15 minutes for it to get any thickness at all; then I added the marshmellow.

I must have had the heat too hight?The sauce came out really thick and it seemed it could use more liquid.This is the first time I tried the recipe and I had problems with the chicken too - when I pounded it out - it broke apart?Any suggestions would be great!But all in all it was that bad - just the cook and her preparation I guess lol!,neutral

"okay, but this needs work.i thought the sauce was too hot and vinegary.this is not the sauce you are used to getting at chinese restaurants, too thin and light colored.also, very messy to make.i needed more than 1/2 cup oil to fry and the chicken took four batches and too long to cook.however, my husband and a coworker both said they liked it and it reheated well.i would try again and add either a some hoisin sauce or red bean paste to darken up the sauce and cut the vinegar in half.also, i would omit the red chiles and use chili paste instead.",neutral
"this was just ok.i had 4 small loin chops about 1/2' thick so i cut ingredients in half.i took tebo's suggestion and added about 1 tablespoon parmesan to the mix.i baked until they were cooked through, barely(about 20 min) but they were not tender, nor was there any ""crunchy crust"", but the mustard flavor was a nice change.i will try again, but proably with tenderloin and saute it in a skillet instead.",neutral
"This is quite good. I threw some frozen green beans in to add to the visual effect, and was quite pleased with the results. Nice onion taste. Thanks JoAnn for a good recipe.",neutral
"This dip was pretty good, except next time I willuse ground beef instead of those yucky re-fried beans.Just my opinion, these things are gross!!I took this dip to a swimming BBQ, and the swimmers quite enjoyed it, so there is no accounting for taste. (my daughter included!)But, other than that, pretty yummy, and you can make it go a long way!",neutral
"this was okay, but not ""oh wow great"".even though i cut the recipe in half, it still made quite a lot.i misread the recipe and did not refrigerate overnight, but wil try again and see if that helps.",neutral
"This was nice, though not overly special. I used white rice instead of brown, and grated carrots instead of celery. I also used a mixture of walnuts and almonds. Even after 40 minutes of baking, the dish didn't really set into a ""loaf""... then again, maybe it wasn't supposed to. This is a good way to use leftovers.",neutral
It smelled great but the chicken had a texture that seems like it's very dry. It just goes to mush when you fork it or chew it. The sauce is a little too sweet. I dreaded my leftovers for lunch today. I won't be making this again.,negative
"Mini, I've had a very bad day, 'scary' infact. I had this for lunch with 2 slices of bread. It helped me relax. Thank YOU.",neutral
Liked the recipe.Had good flavor,neutral
"Liked the recipe, but would like a little more spice.",neutral
After much debating I gave this a 3* only though because DH prefers a crisy edge to his pork.For ease of cooking it was definitely a 5.We really enjoyed the flavour. I will be making this again. Thanks for posting.Cheers Jen,neutral
"This was something different from the usual cabbage. This combo of a fruit and vegetable recipe worked well. I used 2 cups of cabbage and 1/3 cup of vinegar. Also substituted the butter with cooking oil. Microwaved it on HIGH for 7 minutes, the cabbage was slightly crunchy! I loved that, had it for lunch",neutral
I followed the directions but something went wrong recipe came out sticky and impossible to can.,negative
I've eaten these before they are good! ,neutral
I live in southeast louisiana. I have lived here my whole life.THIS IS NOT GUMBO!!!!!!!!,negative
"I cooked these at the recommended temp for the recommended time, (3 potatoes and 3 tablespoons butter) and they weren't anywhere near ready. I then turned the heat up for 15 minutes more, and then ended up still needing to finish them off in the microwave for 5 minutes. I have a new oven, and I check it with a thermometer, so maybe I cut the potatoes too thick. I cut them the same way I always do when making scalloped potatoes though.",neutral
"This was a very easy and quick recipe!However, I did do some tweaking the first time I made it and would probaby do a little more tweaking the next time.I like heat so I used diced tomatoes w/ chilies (may not be available everywhere) and also added a dash of cayenne powder and 2 dashes of tobasco sauce.The only other thing I'd change is to add more eat and/or include less tomato paste because the end result was a little too tomatoey and not as meaty or thick as I like it.",neutral
"I had to make some ""substitutions"". I was out of onions and dry bread crumbs. I substituted fresh mushrooms (chopped finely) for the onions (my daughter wouldn't eat them anyway) and crushed SEASONED CROUTONS for the dry bread crumbs. Then I combined a can of cream of mushroom soup,1 cup of water, and a package of brown gravy to the pan for a gravy. Simmered the ""steaks"" in it for a few minutes. My daughter and husband LOVED it! Although, I would OMIT the final breading stage (unless using actual BREAD CRUMBS would make that huge of a difference.",neutral
"This was ok. The sauce was nice- like a sweet and sour.While I was cooking it, I wondered how the heck the sauce would thicken on its own. So I dumped it in the blender with a tablespoon of cornstarch. Then I put it back in the pan. It thickened up nicely. Also, the chops were bland. I did put some garlic in with the oil and sprinkled the chops with garlic poweder. I think next time I would marinate the chops a day ahead for extra flavor. Oh, by the way, this makes lots of sauce. I would make mashed potatoes, noodles, or rice with this.",neutral
I used Tenderloin but was not happy with the marinade paste falling off - I can't imagine that would be the original Central Market recipe.I'm calling them tomorrow to find out because the flavor was great.Thanks to Titanium Chef for suggesting foil protection -- that could be a great help and I did follow the instructions and do Tinatium Chef's onions - they were awsome.,negative
"It good, but it lacks zest. I recommend adding 1-2 lemons according to their size. You can also add rice and sausage.",neutral
"Whoa, this was really spicy! Scaling down to 1 serving, I decided to be brave and add all of the optional 1 1/2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes, and boy, it burned! The sesame flavour comes through nicely though. This was a fairly easy recipe to put together, but I need to adjust the seasonings to suit my taste.",neutral
"This is a very rich pasta salad, it's great for those who want super savoury taste.The quantity of balsamic vinegar is way too much.I halved the amount required.This is good on its own or with another light green salad mix.Too heavy to go with any other carbs in the one meal.",neutral
"Very easy dish to prepare. However, it was lacking in taste. May I suggest reserving the peach juice/syrup, adding some soy sauce. Heat this on the stove and add the peaches (chopped). When the recipe calls for the peaches to be added to the chicken, pour the ""sauce"" you have created over the chicken and finish baking. Place the chicken and peaches over cooked rice.",neutral
This is a great summer recipe!!I chose this because my mother is on a low cholesterol diet. We were looking for something healthy and low-fat and low-cholesterol.The yogurt combined with the cinnamon and the natural sugar in the apples and pineapple make this a sweet tasting salad without paying for it.,neutral
"I did find the recipie to be a bit salty.I took the juice from the roast, added a bit of Beef Dip powder, and water to taste and it made an excellent beef dip which had a lot more flavour then just the plain au jus mix.",neutral
"can anyone who has cooked this recipe possibly recommend a conversion for stovetop or microwcooking, instead of oven baking? thanks! hoping to have one soon!",neutral
"I made this today and if you like things with bananas, this is for you! I was glad that this was not a drink that only filled the glass halfway-it filled it almost to the top! I love being able to call that much ""1 serving""! Also, I didn't mix mine as much, so it was like a malt-type texture- really good- and very filling. Next time I think that I am going to add a little more peanut butter and maybe even some chocolate flavor...or vanilla...or some strawberries! The possibilities are endless!",neutral
"Made this(after scaling it down to 1 serving) at 11pm tonight. I have been feeling so off mood all day long, tensed and just tired basically with my lengthy assignment. This woke me up I liked the punch of the lemon juice in particular in this coffee. Thanks Mini! This will surely keep me up for some more hours, which I really needed badly",neutral
"To turn this into an outstanding recipe, start by frying 5 finely sliced cloves of garlic, then add the other ingredients as set out in the recipe. You might also wish to add some coriander, or as you Yanks call it, some cilantro.Yummmmmmy either way, either on pasta or just as a side dish. Omit the garlic and the coriander and it's a great breakfast dish. And healthy too !!",neutral
"Good recipe as far as the basic ingredients are concerned, but you left out the single most important bit of advice: USE THAI BASIL IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!!Thai basil (Gra Pow) is much more complex and fragrant than its relatively bland Italian/French cousin and holds up much better under heat.It is well worth the adventure to try to find some.Most US cities have an Asian grocery store (fun to go to anyway), and most will have Gra Pow.Give this fantastic dish its just reward! [Editors note: Julesong appreciated these comments and has updated the recipe to refect this great suggestion.]",neutral
"Quite tasty, but we found the muffins just atad too dry.However, will definitely make them again, but with more butter.",neutral
"I doubled the recipe and made it for lunch this afternoon using a 1kg 300 gms chicken . I had to add 1 tsp. garam masala powder, 1 1/2 tsps. salt, 1 tsp more of red chilli powder, 1/2 tsp. more of turmeric powder and 1/8 tsp. of red food colouring. Garnished it with cilantro and served it with chappatis. Next time, I'll add half the quantity of yogurt and probably add 2-3 green chillies also. Will try again",neutral
"This did not have too bad of a taste, however, I'm not real big on mixing a citric juice with milk because it will curdle.I am not a milk lover, and so the thought of curdled milk is not good to me.",neutral
"Miller, this was tasty, but it had a tendancy to curdle. I went back and checked the recipe because I followed the directions, exactly, but, it curdled and didn't cook properly. Maybe it's my oven. I'd like to make it again, but I think I'll use the smaller can of evoporated milk and cook it for not less than an hour. Anyhow,I probably messed up somehow, cause the taste was good.",neutral
"I would give this 3 and a half stars. This was quite nice but I felt it lacked something in the flavour. The cake mixture was very dry when I was making it, I added the butter and milk but there wasn't enough liquid to combine the ingredients so I had to add extra milk. I cooked it for 35 minutes which was fine.There wasn't much sauce and it was quite thick and difficult to serve. I liked that the top was crispy due to the sugar. This was nice with ice-cream.",neutral
I found this recipe to taste great but it took forever for it to set up.I believe some of the instructions are missing. I had to add 1 1/2 cups more of sugar in the end to get it to set.It is a great hit with my family though.,neutral
It didn't taste very good and I have my friend that is a chef cook it so I didn't mess it up.,negative
"I am giving a rating of only three stars because the directions are incomplete. I am an experienced cook so I was able to modify it to come out tasting good. However a novice cook would have trouble with it. I suggest that when you come to the direction to add ""the rest of the flour add only enough to make a very soft dough. Turn out on to the counter and knead in enough additional flour to make a soft but not sticky dough. Keep flouring the counter to keep the cut out doughnuts from sticking to the counter top.Hope this helpsCheers.",neutral
"I had some really fresh homegrown strawberries, so decided to give this a try. Disappointed with the texture and the flavour, so turned it into what we in the U.K call ""Lollies"" (Frozen moulds), great success there.",neutral
"This was pretty good, but I found that there was too much butter/oil for my tastes. Next time, I will halve the butter/oil and see how it goes.",neutral
This was pretty good for a low fat and low cholesterol dish.It was slightly grainy though.,neutral
This title is a bit misleading for those who know true SE Asia cooking.The recipe is interesting though and I recommend it.I would lighten up on the soy sauce in the peanut sauce-it over powers it.Overall a good meal worth repeating.,neutral
"this was very good.Instead of cocoa, I used diet hot chocolate packets(swiss miss) and poured the packets into the rest of the mix. (No fat, 4 carbs,1 sugar and only 20 calories per packet. You can taste the chocolate so you cannot go wrong with using this.",neutral
I think this might be improved by adding some cheese to the sauce and using noodles instead of macaroni (the suggestions of my family of food critics).,neutral
"This didn't work well for me at all! It tasted nice, but was too liquidy and was more like soup than pudding. I even turned the milk mixture back to the stove and let it boil some more after adding the cornstarch mixture, but it didn't help. Are you sure the amount of cornstarch is correct?",neutral
"I followed the recipe exactally, but mine came out like hard pralines. I feel like there was a missing ingredient. The ""candy"" had a great taste though. I would love to have it as a jam.",negative
"The fruit combo, and spices on the fruit were really good.However, the ""crisp"" part was not very crispy, and remained powdery, even after baking.It never got golden brown.As a whole, it was good, but I've had better.",neutral
"I made this cake with raisins. Although the taste was quite good, I was not very satisfied with the texture, which was a bit dry and heavy.",neutral
"I'm sorry, Inez, most all your food is great, but for me this didn't hit the spot. I'll keep fixing mine. Unless I did something wrong, this was a ""white"" gravy sauce. Being from southeast Louisiana, we're mostly fond of brown gravy made with a roux.",negative
it's a grreat party drink thats full of fun and tasty,neutral
I tried this the other night and found it to be fantastic. Will do it again only (I agree with the others- it is salty) so I will cut back on the mixes.,neutral
"This was good, most of my family loves asparagus - I prefer fresh vs. canned but still a winner.We served this over pan fried egg noodles.Would also be good over rice though.",neutral
"Reminicient of Swiss Steak ala Pork.Enjoyed this recipe over home made egg noodles.A good basic sauce for beef, pork and chicken.",neutral
"im not sure if everyone who reviewed this are health freaks or not, but considering it uses a fair amount of ingrediants, it dosn't taste very nice. the honey and lemon juice dont go with strawberrys.try it if you want but i wouldn't recommend spending the cash to make it.we didn't put in the rice bran,does that make much difference?if so then i may make it again, but otherwise dont waste your money, just bung in cornish ice cream, plain yogurt and banana. tastes much nicer,its more simple and cheaper!",negative
"This was okay, but not what I had hoped for.Again, I tried a recipe that I would normally pass over(lack of info) because of the glowing reviews.I had no idea as to what type vinegar to use, white, rice, sherry, balsamic, so I opted for apple cider as I thought that was a common type.What type did other reviewers use?I cut the amounts for everything in half because I was using 4 boneless chicken breasts and that is roughly equal to half a chicken.I cooked 6 hrs on low and the chicken was quite dry, and the sauce way too sweet.I may try again with half the amount of sugar called for and perhaps sherry wine vinegar.And definitely cook for less time.",neutral
I love Snow Peas and this recipe is a keeper.Next time I will add garlic salt and more beef broth to give it more flavor.Thanks for the recipe!,neutral
"This was good, I used a chocolate cake mix .. Thay work very well when you are in a hurry but I think cookies made from scratch are better .. thanks",neutral
I made this last night for supper...I like spice so I added an 1/8 tsp. of cayenne pepper. I also served mine over orzo. Liked the overall flavor of the dish but....the tofu still tasted tasteless to me.,neutral
"I love cabbage and pasta, but this was not much more than that. I also love flavor, which this didn't have enough of. So I added some onions and corned beef and gobbled the rest up. ",negative
"This was not a five star recipe. The flavor was just not there. Yes,it was easy to put together and there was no pan to wash but that is all lost it the dish doesn't taste good. There was not one family member that liked this recipe.",negative
"Fast and easy but too much pepper for us. Next time I think I will use less pepper and add more oriental spices such as ginger and extra soy sauce.We also used green pepper and snow peas, but didn't use the almonds and served it over rice.",neutral
"None of the flavours of the liquid/spice mixture was prominent in the final product – this was unexpected but not at all unpleasant. The meat was incredibly moist and tender, but I believe that the crockpot gets more credit than does the chef for that. I used fresh orange zest, beer, and otherwise changed nothing in the recipe. It was voted “OK” at the dinner table.",neutral
"When I read that the chicken got dry for some cooks, I didn't believe it, but it did. Weird! Acutally, I think all this recipe needs is a little oil or something similar to seal in moisture. The vinegar and soy dried the chicken out, I'm sure. The taste was great - a little too sweet, so I added a beef bouillon cube (didn't have any chicken ones) and about 1/4 cup of cooking sherry. Served this over noodles w/a side of corn and homemade bread. Thickened the sauce too. I may make it again, but will tweak the recipe a bit. It does remind you of a Chinese dish. I'm really not trying to plug one of my recipes, but if you like moist chicken in the crockpot, try Chicken Delicious...very easy and yummy!",neutral
"I add a bay leaf and use only beef stock vice bouillon cubes.The cubes introduce too much salt (you already have 2 teaspoons).At the end, just before serving, I add 1 tablespoon of sherry or madeira wine.Also, an additional variation is to cut down the cooking time, on simmer, to 1 1/2 hours.",neutral
"NOt bad...NOt bad.I made most of them without putting anything, such as chips and nuts, in them.On a few though, I did put mint chips in them and LORDIE they were as good as sin.I also tried using some cappuccino chips in them, but those were just a little bad:(You HAVE to try using mint flavoured chips in these babies!!!",neutral
Salad was good although we didn't like it as much as everyone else.,neutral
I must have used the wrong sized can of lime-aid in this recipe.I used a large one since the recipe did not specify and it was so sweet we couldn't eat it.I won't make this one again.,neutral
How much fruit?,neutral

"Perhaps I'm looking for something more from my brisket.Although the meat was tender, there just wasn't any good flavor.This recipe was no good.I wouldn't make it again.",negative
"I'm so sorry to do this Yooper, but we had these for dinner tonight, and they just didn't suit our taste. The meaballs were certainly tasty and juicy, but the sauce was really bitter with so much nutmeg. Can I suggest to anyone else trying this recipe to add the nutmeg in the sauce a pinch at a time until you find the level you will enjoy. I had to laugh at myself as I faithfully added the andquot;extra teaspoon of waterandquot; (wondering all the time what it did!) then realised it was probably the salt.",neutral
"The use of so much fresh lemon juice and the lemon butter sauce really over-powers the whole dish.Pernod can add such a wonderful flavor to a mussel preparation and with the lemon juice, you couldn't even taste the Pernod.It had a great amount of garlic, which we love, and all other ingredients were very good.I doubled the recipe because we love mussels, but I really don't think that had any bearing on the end results.I will prepare this again, but definately cut the lemon at least in half in all preparation of the recipe. I will let you know how it turns out!!Amazingly, I found this recipe also listed as a Copy Cat recipe (on another recipe web site) for a mussel's appetizer served at Carraba's (which my husband and I absolutely LOVE)and it isn't even anywhere close or in the ball park of that oustanding preparation that they do.If anyone has that recipe, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE post!!!!",neutral
"The crust was very dense and hard to cut, making it impossible to eat without splattering oneself with blueberry goop, until I got the knives out.It did not want to set up and so took about 20 minutes longer to bake. I keep a thermometer in my oven because I bake alot of bread so the temp was not the problem.We ate 2 pieces and threw the rest away.",negative
"This is a pretty good salad, but I really think the olives do more damage than add flavor.Out of all the salads I made for last night's cookout, this one was the least popular.I followed the recipe exactly as written (okay, I used a red pepper instead of a green one).I do plan to make it again, without the olives this time.If it's better received I will update my review.",neutral
"In order to cut down on the fat, I sauteed some mushrooms and added them to fat free canned gravy from Von's.Tasted fine.Still a little high in fat, but once in a while one has to blow the ol' good sense diet just a bit.",neutral
"It was an easy dish, but I found it to be very bland in taste.I think if I would have added a little bit of garlic powder and Onion salt, it would have enhanced the flavor.It wasnt at all what I expected.(I was expecting it to be a little creamy, dont know why i thought that either because of the eggs in it.) But it was still well liked in my home.",neutral
I've been looking for a ceasar salad recipe but pasta instead of romain lettuce and I have yet to find the right dressing for the pasta...this is the only one i seemed to like and try for my new recipe....it tasres great but omit the anchovy and garlic as I am not a seafood or garlic lover.,neutral
"This recipe is good, but slightly runny. I took it to our Thanksgiving party at work last year, and it spilled all over my car on the way there. When it was time to eat, though, it was really good, and everyone there liked it.",neutral
"The flavor of the filling was really good! I did make two tiny changes.The first was I added some chopped garlic because we love garlic.The second was instead of boiling then draining the cauliflower, I just cut it smaller and sauteed it with the onions and garlic. The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 4 is because the crust, although good around the edges, was kind of mushy on the bottom.I think I will make this again but with a regular pie crust.Thanks for the recipe.",neutral
I did not make this recipe but my sister did . She dose not do much cooking .I was really surprised in the taste ! Didn't think cold peas would taste that good ! IT was excellent with our 4th of July Thanksgivivg Feast !! She said its really easy and it was her second presantation and its been a hit at the picnics ! Looks so interesting U have to try it!,neutral
One of the worst pastry doughs I have ever tried.,negative
I tried this recipe last night and it wasn't anything special. The taste was good and it was soft and easy to make but the texture was terrible. As soon as I touched the pie it crumbled to pieces. Very poor texture.,neutral
This was tasty however the cheese stuck to the roof of my mouth *G* I think maybe i will use my sandwich maker and just make it a toasted sandwich instead of an open faced sandwich,neutral
"This is good, but too salty for our tastes.I would make it again, but use only 1 1/2 T. of the Salad Supreme Seasoning.I would supplement that by adding more paprika and garlic powder.I cannot believe the sodium content in the analysis.",neutral
This is an excellent dish for vegetarian eating.Very filling and light but with a depth of flavour.Time consuming to prepare but good even the day after.I would be more apt to serve this along with a meat main course like grilled chicken.,neutral
"This recipe is similar to cookies/candy I made in Home Ec. back in the 80s.I really like the combination of peanut butter and chocolate, but the texture of the cookies was fragile.The cookies never really became firm.I added a smidgen more peanut butter than the recipe called for - may that's why.",neutral
"Sorry Sue, but this one didn't thrill any of us for various reasons.I found that putting all the veg in together meant that the beans and celery had dried out way too much before the carrot was cooked.It was a big panful of veg, so it needed all of an hour to have them cooked, because the ones in the centre didn't cook unless you moved them around pretty often.I liked all the herbs in it and the tomatoes, though I would probably use tinned tomatoes and some of their juices next time. The eggplant really hogged all the oil and left the other veg a bit on the dry side.",neutral
"Had never tried meatloaf in the crockpot, so had to have a go at it.Not bad, but I think something was lost in the process, there was not a lot of taste. I think I would add more dry mustard and more garlic next time. It took about 6 hours to cook which was perfect timing for our dinner. Served salsa at the table with it, to add a little zing.It did make good meatloaf sandwiches for lunch the next day, with added mustard, onion slices, dill pickle, kinda like a meatloaf cold hamburger sandwich.We found it to be better the next day as a sandwich.Thanks for sharing.",neutral
"to help this recipe to be a little better,you should mix the chesse into the mix, and instead of regular milk use evaporated milk.",neutral
I also found the recipe to be a little dry and done very quickly.I am using a 6qt slow cooker so maybe that's why.It is very tasty though!,neutral
A little too spicy for my taste.Next time I will probably eliminate the red pepper.It was somewhat like fried fish but a little dry.,neutral
I found that these didn't have much flavor.They are a more nutritional alternative to plain pancakes.,neutral
"Made these according to recipe today. I rechecked the recipe after eating them to make sure I didn't forget something as I was expecting them to be really out of this world.I'm not a big stew person and this was very much like a sweet stew to me. The pork chops definitely got very tender and that was nice.They weren't really bad, but no one said they looked forward to having them again. Maybe being from South Texas, I just was missing some spice and heat.",neutral
"Would be more useful if U.S. measurements were used instead of some metric -- it is annoying to have to stop and convert 250 ml or l25g. Recipe is very good, (sultanas are raisins by the way) - it is very close to one I use every year instead of fruitcake which nobody in the family likes.",neutral
"I love the tartness of lime and the mild heat of radish. However, when I put the two of them together I found the lime was just sour and the radish had very little taste!!Might just be my odd taster!!!",neutral
great sauce but where does one find durkee's??? I called 3 stores with no luck...so i just left it out and added some old bay seasoning.It turned out great anyway...however be prepared for a definate mustard flavor in this sauce.Next time i will probably cut down on the mustard.,neutral
"Thought this was a little bland, but when I put it in a tortilla with cilantro and some extra spices it was great.",neutral
"This smelled great as it was cooking, but my meat-eating husband was not thrilled (though he finished his plate.)Leftovers just sat in the frig.",neutral
I gave this recipe 1 star because the pork chops were tender.The sauce was way to sweet.I would not make these again.I threw all the left-overs away.Sorry!,negative
"I didn't care for it as given in the recipe so..I made the loaf into garlic bread. Used tom. sauce in place of soup. Chopped peppers, onions, mushrooms, italian seasonings and replaced the cheese with mozzerella and parmesan. It was like dipping your bread into your spaghetti sauce without the hassle of the noodle. It was great!! Thanks for the idea.",neutral
"These were good. Since I like to make my cookies larger than the usual sized, this made 32 cookies for me. I did not grease my baking dish as the mixture already had enough margarine in it. I'm not too sure whether cake flour means the same as all-purpose flour ,or if the latter can be substituted for the former. But, I made this using all purpose flour and it was good. Thanks!",neutral
Used on babyback ribs.Do NOT recommend.Chili powder was overpowering.,negative
"Very bready cookie. Too much flour and not enoughsweetness to make it taste anyghing like a Loft House sugar cookie. I'm still on the look out. They don't sell anything like the loft house cookies here in Canada, so if anyone has a tried and true recipe I'd be ever so grateful if you'd share. I'm addicted to these cookies and I only get to get across the border for shopping about 4 times a year.",negative

A little tart for my taste but tasted really good to have no sugar in it.I'll make it again for my diabetic clients.,neutral
"I tried making this dish...It was a mess from the start.There are definately some steps missing.I started by cooking the beans on low heat with the coconut milk and it was all downhill from there.The milk was gone within a half an hour and then I was thinking ""How is this suppose to cook rice if you dont add anymore liquid to the recipe?""So basicly what Im trying to say is...this recipe definately needs some tweeking, and until then.... dont try it!",negative
"I made this over the 4th July weekend and it was really easy to make. I personally didn`t care for it, the texture was just not what I expected. However there were people who did say they liked it and about 1/2 of the pie was eaten, perhaps more coconut flavor would help.",neutral

"I basically can my tomatoes the same way, but I add canning salt and sugar of equal amounts.If it's a pint jar then I add 1 tsp. of each.I would be afraid of these if I didn't hot water bath them, but I'm not going to add lemon juice to my canned tomatoes.You want your family and friends to enjoy your canning and not have to worry about their health.",neutral
"This was easy to prepare, but my family did not care for it.Too much mayonaise taste and it was salty for us.I am going to keep searching, hopefully finding the recipe my Mom used to prepare in the 50's.That was really good!",neutral
The pickles in this ruined it for me.And I am a huge pickle fan. But something about the rice with everything else just didn't strike my fancy.,negative
I served this at a Scandinavian party and the results were positive.I did however add more lemon juice and more sugar.I baked the potatoes the day ahead and peeled them.It went over quite well and was pretty too.,neutral
"My husband is a real dreamsicle nut so I had to try this.I didn't gift package it yet so I don't know how pretty it is. The cookies turned out well, worth keeping for their uniqueness alone. However I would change a few things if you are making them for yourself. First off they were a bit too sweet, (which is a near impossiblity with me)so I would cut the sugar quite a bit. The tang added quite a bite to them, now I'm not a usual tang drinker so I bought an off brand, I don't know if it tasted any different or not. The tang crystals don't dissolve so I think it makes them bite more. Next time I'll try dissolving it first.Lastly, just for the sake of looks. I would add a bit of orange food coloring to the dough to make the white chips stand out more. I'm not for sure how all this would translate in the gift mix. Perhaps you could add the color to the sugar and have a layer of orange sugar. That might be pretty.I think I'd advise a little less tang in the gift jar instead of worrying about dissolving it seperately.All in all I thought it was a nice unusually tasting cookie. I'll make it again soon after I tweek it.",neutral
"These were heavier than I prefer, just a personal taste though.",neutral
I really didn't like this recipe. The nutmeg messed it all up!,negative
This was good although too sweet for my taste. I think next time I will make the pudding according to directions and then add whipping cream. The red raspberries are not one of my favorites so I'll try something else next time. But it was good with the peaches. Thank you for posting this recipe!!!,neutral
"Basic, easy, flavorful recipe.We made it the first time doing as the recipe called for and found it good but the chilis were a little overwhelming for us.Tried it again a few days later adding another half pound hamburger to the recipe and were much more pleased.Will definitely do this one again.",neutral
"I thought it was alright,but like everyone said i should have added garlic powder",neutral
I have found most people like this with less jalepeno.I like to make it in very large batches with lots of tomato.Also be careful not to add too much celantro.It quickly will overpower the recipe.,neutral
The recipe came out very soggy. It was almost ineatable!!,negative
"This is a very nice (as well as super fast and easy) way to bake fish...the tomato slices atop the filets are a very welcome ""something different""! We actually substituted fresh Walleye Pike from beautiful Lake Kampeska which my husband caught this afternoon. YUM! I really loved it, but my hubby who is WAY more of a fried fish guy, insisted it was only worth 3 stars! Still, a WONDERFUL recipe!!!",neutral
This tastes like a spiced up sweet/sour sauce and also works very well with firm fruit. This tastes similar to a spicy sweet sour sauce and also works very well on firm fruit.,neutral
"This was nice, but I felt that the sesame seeds overwhelmed all the other ingredients. I made the chocolate variety, and it probably needed some more maple syrup because mine turned out barely sweet. I omitted the coconut, which I'm not too fond out, and cut these into squares. I used cashew butter, but could barely taste it. I'll tweak this a tad the next time I make it.",neutral
"these are alright,some times we put flour on top then we fry them",neutral
This was refreshing. But A little too sweet for our family. Next time I will cut the sugar in half.,neutral

This was wonderful--finally got around to using the A to Z ingredients--and I used 2 cups of strawberries! this bread was great--it will be in my cookbook for good because of its totally unmatched level of versatility.,positive
It was incredibly salty.It was probably the brand of Teriyaki sauce I used (kikoman).It tasted like salt soup.I checked the contents of the sauce and it was 25% sodium.,negative
"These were different!The smarties melted in trhe cookie and gave them a tangy taste.I had to add more flour to mine,they really spread....but it may be because I used butter instead of margerine.",neutral

"This is no way to cook eggs! First, use a pin to punch a hole in the big end of the eggs.This prevents cracking, that is caused by expansion of the air bubble in the big end. Cover the eggs well with COLD water.Cover the pan, and bring to a boil over medium heat (this method works only on an electric stove).As soon as the water is bopiling, turn off the heat.Leave the pot on the element. After some hours, once the water is at room temperature, peel the eggs (use a spoon to crack the shell all over, then, under a running tap, roll the egg between your palms.The shell can then be easily removed.

"I've been wanting to make this recipe for a really long time, so I was really glad when I had the time off to give this a try. Since it was a rice pudding, I was expecting a pudding-ey consistency, but even after cooking the rice-milk mixture for 3 hours, it was still pretty soupy! Since the recipe didn't specify what type of rice to use, I used medium-grain... perhaps I should've used short grain for it to be of a creamier consistency. Also, the salt also seemed a bit much, but the vanilla added a nice flavour. This was just sweet enough for my liking, but the consistency could do with loads of improvement.",neutral

"Nice change of pace for an easy rice dish.I used half the amount of butter (margarine, actually) and added a 1/3 cup more of rice.The liquid to rice proportions seemed a bit off in the original recipe.Will try it next time with a dark beer and have it with beef!",neutral
Not very good,negative
I scaled the recipe down to 1 serving. I added 2 tbsp oats and 1/2 tsp. honey as well. I did not use the ground cinnamon. Had this with 2 slices of toasted bread for a light lunch and now its 7pm and not very hungry yet! Thanks Dancer!,neutral
"This was OK.After all the rave reviews, I expected it to be spectacular.It just seemed that something was missing.Not bad, just not what I expected.",neutral
"Mediocre.The recipe calls for too much lemon juice for my taste...and the consistency of the sauce was odd.Had to pick the chicken out of the leftovers, rinse it, and make chicken salad because no one (including myself) liked this dish.Sorry!",neutral
"I’m afraid I have to agree with Jenn. I found these ribs to be very tender, but I found them lacking in flavor and I found three onions a bit much, slightly overpowering. I also didn’t like the idea that I had to be around mid-recipe to drain off the liquid. I think in part Kelly that you’re right, everyone has their own favorite rib recipe and I think that was the standard I was measuring these against. None-the-less they were relatively easy to prepare and as I said they were very tender.",neutral
"There's something missing in this recipe. With all the seasonings and all that garlic, you would think it would have quite a bit of flavor. However, both hubby and I thought it was extremely bland. He tossed most of his in the garbage and that's very uncharacteristic.Won't be making this one again.",negative
I ended up leaving these in the oven for an hour which was way too long.I think even the 40 mins as the recipe calls for might have be a bit much. They tasted all right but I've had better. Maybe the dijon mustard idea would add some pizazz.,neutral
"It's a nice base recipe. It's kind of bland as is, but the proper spices would liven it up.",neutral
"A fairly easy dish to prepare and the chicken had good flavor but not quite as good as the cooking aroma led me to think it was going to taste.I used skinless thighs and cut as much extra fat off as I could.About five minutes before the chicken was done, I tossed in some chopped zucchini and let it cook in the sauce with the chicken.The zucchini turned out really well.",neutral
"This recipie is incomplete.I started making it and it doesn't tell you what to do with the vinegar, salt or the onions.I gave up and made another recipie.Sorry..it looks like a great recipie but I didn't want a disaster by adding the wrong ingredient at the wrong time.",negative
Liked the recipe but next time I'll use sour cream rather than mayo - my MIL makes it w/sour cream and no onion.The sour cream coats the cucumbers more.,neutral
"We didn't like it very much, just not much flavor, I followed the directions to a T, just expected More Flavor from this. Okay, not bad, just expecting too much from this I think.",neutral
"This was a nice change of pace and I liked the fact that I can serve it at room temp or chilled. Good crunchy veggies and the fresh mint (which grows in my garden with abandon) added a great touch. I can see adding other crunchy veggies such as julienne snow peas and summer squash. I plopped it in a big salad for a lunch and I used it in pocket bread too. I liked it but the fam, who are a bunch of picky eaters, were not so ""enamored"" of it. I will make it again and probably eat it all myself.",neutral
very good recipe i was out of french dressing which iusually use and did'nt have catilina neither so i put the dressing in called green goddess you have to try it talk about exxcellent it is great i took it to family cookout and everyone wentcrazy over it you'll have to give it a try.,neutral
"At a 20-minute baking time, these brownies came out too dry. Good peanut-butter taste,but no gooey/gummy brownie texture.",neutral
"I followed the recipe and when I took the foil off after cooking it was pretty dry and the rice was still hard. I had even added the water from the can of corn. So I added about a half cup more water, salt and red pepper and losely covered and cooked for about 15 more minutes. I added more cheese and let it sit in the hot oven for about 20 more minutes. Now the rice is perfect and the dish taste pretty good. Pretty basic but the ease and taste makes it worth trying.",neutral
"This was VERY VERY VERY disappointing.Since typically, everything from this site that has a good rating is always great, I made this for my FIL's birthday dinner.It didn't look good and tasted a bit like a soft pretzel--NOT like foccacia.I wonder if the chef has had real foccacia before?I made 2 batches, one following directions exactly and then a second that would be a rosemary focaccia.It was easy, (used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix up the dough) but just wasn't foccacia.I WOULD NOT make it again and will be looking for a more authenic recipe.",negative

I must say the chicken was amazing.It fell right off the bones.The stuffing did not turn out so great though.I suggest removing all the fat and probably the skin and perhaps use a little less liquid.My stuffing turned out the consistancy of soup and it was greasy.I followed the recipe to a 't'.I plan on trying it again with my suggestions and I will get back to you.,neutral
"This was quite nice. I enjoyed the mixture of flavours. I found the flavour a little bit too strong though, maybe too much soy sauce for me. It overshadowed the lime and ginger flavours too much. I found it difficult to eat the whole piece of fish because of this. I would like to reduce the soy sauce to just a few drops next time.",neutral

"I found this took much longer than 10 minutes to prep.My DH liked this Chowder but I didn't care for it that much. I guess I just prefer a different style. I prefer a light broth type instead of a thick stew. I did make some changes. I used fresh salmon instead of canned, which I think was nicer. And I used salmon broth that I had made, instead of chicken broth which I also liked. It gave the chowder a nice salmon taste.I did like using the fresh corn that was suggested in the recipe. That was a nice touch. And I think I'll use that idea again when I make a different version of Salmon Soup. Just not a chowder next time.",neutral

Charishma...this twist is good but the cals indicated weighed heavily on my mind..I wonder what is adding on to all the cals here..I have a similar recipe that was posted sometime ago called No Fuss Red Kidney Bean Salad (and you had rated the same as well) which has almost similar ingredients but the cals are far too less out there.,neutral
I thought this was fair. My mom gave it a five but it's a hassle to make. probably won't make this again.,neutral

"I was so anxious to try this after reading all the great reviews, but...I wasn't very impressed.I feel like maybe I did something wrong, but in this recipe there aren't many possibilities of doing that.I put some halved carrots and yukon gold potatoes on the bottom, then the roast, (and it wasn't a cheap one) then a quartered onion on top.I sprinkled half the mix on top, mixed the rest with 3/4 c water--thought I might need extra because of the vegetables- and poured it over.9 hours low heat.I wound up with a not substantially tenderroast and lots of watery broth.I thickened the broth with some browned flour, and it was all good, not great. For a pot roast I would stick to the one baked in foil in the Betty Crocker cookbook.",neutral
"This recipe very nearly works as it is.I didn't want to add sugar because I didn't want to blacken the fish, but after 1 steak, I added 1/2 again as much catsup and about an extra 1/4 cup of orange juice, to try to cut the saltiness of the soy.It more or less does the trick.Perhaps try cutting the soy sauce down just a tad.",neutral
"I am with reviewer Marcia Smith on this one. It was not bad but I don't think it deserves the highest rating on the site. I tried it and followed the recipe faithfully and was quite disappointed. I tasted as I thought it would ...sweet andsomewhat ho-hum. The best that can be said for it is that it is easy and for those with weak teeth, the chops are tender.I would far rather marinate aboneless pork steak and grill it. I have given it one star and am not sure it deservs that.I prefer to give good reviews but this recipe has been so over-rated that I felt I should help to correct the balance.",negative

My tastebuds really didn't care for this.It wasn't icky or anything. It is just the cheese kind of takes over and that is all I could taste. To me it tasted like it needs something.Probably a good base recipe but definately needs doctoring with spices and such.Sorry,neutral
"As a die-hard falafel aficionado, I tried this recipe over the weekend.I found that although the outcome was very, very tasty, it took far too long to make.I will eat falafels 3+ times per week, so I typically buy a pre-mixed falafel powder from the bulk section of a nearby Asian food store.On the other hand, the tahini was absolutely fabulous and I will never-ever-ever buy a premade tahini sauce again.You can even make more, and keep it in the fridge in a Tupperware container.",neutral

"I love to give five star ratings and was kinda disappointed when we tried this recipe.We are going to try to make this one more time minus the ketchup...it seemed really overpowering for some reason.

"This was quick and easy but I think the cooking time for chicken needs to be longer than indicated.I used boneless chicken thighs instead of chicken breasts (because I bought the wrong package) and it turned out okay, but I needed to cook the chicken longer.I also couldn't find McCormick's chicken stir-fry seasoning, so I used ""sun bird stir fry seasoning"" and I added one green pepper.But all in all it is a good quick recipe a middle-of-the-week meal.",neutral

"This was ok, but not what I was expecting. I was hoping for a bean salad-type dish, but it's more like a soup. Also, it didn't really taste very tropical. I think if you used half of the tomatoes and beans it would be better. This recipe made ALOT!!I suggest using a 14 oz can of tomatoes, and a 15 oz can of beans. (Or similar). That way, it's not soupy, and you would be able to taste the tropical flavor better. Also,I didn't have enough lemon juice, so I also added some orange juice. It was good that way.The potato flakes I used were butter flavor, but I didn't care for that. So you might want to use plain flavor.",neutral
"The recipe seemed to be a great idea, but what I got was a rather bland fiber that tasted like nothing more than cheese and hot pepper flakes. Sort of like eating the white parts of cabbage leaves with spices or parmesan cheese on toast.. I gave it 3 stars only because it did not taste bad, and as a budget stretcher or as filler for a wet salad it works if you need to fill the bowl.",neutral
"I have to agree with Kari on this one. Maybe cooking for so long in the crockpot just washed out most of the cheese taste that I was hoping to find. This might go better if cooked in the oven at 350 degrees (f) for one hour per pound. The 3 stars were given because although it did not taste great, no damage was done either and some times the crockpot is the only way to go if you are going to be gone all day.",neutral

"Fun and easy recipe for kabobs. I made the marinade mixture early in the day, and put the meat and shrimp in the marinade for about four hours.

"I added an extra table spoon of Lowery's Season Salt and 1/2 cream... that little extra helped balance out the soup.Also, when I blended the meat and vegies I had a strange thick floating layer on the soup... It was a bit scary.

"It is blackberry season here in Oregon so I thought I would try this recipe.This did not work very well as a pie.The sour cream does not mix with the berries during baking, so you end up with a some very juicy berries on bottom and a soaked crust.The top part is good where the berries and sour cream mix and the crumbs on top are really a nice touch.Probably best to mix berries and sour cream before adding them to the pie shell.Adding corn starch rather than flour would probably work better as well.I used a standard pie crust, this might work best with a graham cracker crust instead.All in all, this recipe needs a bit of work but should be worth the effort.",neutral
"The muffins were pretty good, they had a strange biscuit-like consistency. But I enjoyed them.

I may have fiddled too much with this recipe so it didn't have the same taste appeal as others have found.I used a pork butt roast and did baste but found there was very little sauce left over.

"Overall, fruity and refreshing.However, I didn't have good luck with the vitamin idea(gritty) and would recommend using calcium fortified OJ and adding 1 TBS wheat germ and/or flax seed meal instead of the vitamin for that extra nutritional punch while maintaining the nice texture of this flavorful smoothie.Also, I used frozen banana to make this smoothie thicker and keep it frosty without having to add ice.",neutral
"We used fresh picked green beans (as fresh as they get--picked then straight into the sink for washing, tipping and cooking) and steamed them in my rice cooker/food steamer.I really had high expectations (if not for myself, then at least for the rest of my family) since I can never get my fill of these greens beans, nor can the rest of may family.I am somewhat sensitive to sweet/sour flavors--either I *really* like it, or I *really* don't!The rest of my family just plain love sweet/sour, and accuse me of not cooking sweet/sour often enough.I finished my serving as did everyone else (nobody went back for more).My husband said I could make them again, and the kids said, ""they were OK, but not really that good.""I really doubt if I will make them again, but I do appreciate that you shared Sue!",neutral

If I decide to give this recipe another try, I would definately add additional seasonings to the chicken to give it more flavor.",neutral
"I was disappointed in the outcome of this dish.I used the exact proportions of everything, except that I had used tomatoes with celery, onion and green pepper, so I added 2 cloves of minced garlic.For some reason, I decided to brown my chicken first and am glad I did.After 3 hours on low I checked and the pasta was sludge. WAY OVERCOOKED.The chicken was done, barely.I think the idea here was great and the flavor combination would be excellent.And while all crockpots do cook differently,(and I did check to make sure mine was on low); either the liquid to pasta ratio was off, or the cooking time was off. I will try again, and this time add the pasta after 3 hours and let cook for 1 hour and see if that might be the solution.Darlene, I hope you keep trying new things in your crockpot and keep on posting them, and I'll be sure to let you know if my modification to the cooking time improves the outcome.",neutral

I added the mushrooms after the cinnamon and before the steak, when they were browned and a lot of the liquid cooked out of them , i added the steak.It worked well enough, the flavours worked well together. The hazelnuts on top were especially nice, I chopped them, some fine, some course, to save some crunchyness.All and all a good recipe, but I had to work it out myself.",neutral
"The chicken did seem sweet, perhaps the confectioners' sugar intensifies the sweetness more than a regular fine sugar would. I think if I make it again I would double the ginger, even it out with the cinnamon. The rice was the best part, wonderful mix of flavours, chili peppers, mushrooms and onion. Like the others, a few too many mushrooms. A very nice presentation.Another time I would leave the sugar out completely, it wasn't cloying, but would be better with out it, to my taste anyway.Good Luck!",neutral

"This recipe was OK. Overall, the pasta was too dry (pesto needed more oil), and not what I expected (pesto tasted too much like tomato-garlic-parsley, and lost the basil and hazelnuts). I would go with more mushrooms, and less pasta, too. It had a good garlicy/tomatoey taste around the shrimp, that was its best point. Still, good luck in the contest!",neutral
The flavor wasn't bad.I did have a real problem trying to keep the cheese on top of the breadsticks.They seemed to get harder after having them in the oven for a second time.Was there a trick to this that was not included in the recipe?,neutral
"I am in agreement with the previous reviewers that the instructions on the cauliflower were vague.I think that I would just blanche the cauliflower because it is going to be baked for 40 minutes and omit one of the eggs.I would also add garlic, dill and fresh Parm. cheese to this recipe.I will combine the dill and fresh Parm. with the egg when I add it to the dish.Thank you for sharing your recipe and good luck with your recipe.",neutral
"When I made this I forgot to add the red pepper flakes however, both hubby and I thought that wouldn't have made enough of a difference to make this a keeper recipe.Both of us found it rather tasteless and bland.

"OK so I made this. Everytime I've tried ""easy"" cabbage roll recipes from Recipezaar, they always taste good but it seems there is always too much rice. I always follow the recipes exact. This time I cut the rice to 4 cups instead of 6. Then ater mixing the ingredients it looked like it needed more meat. I had used one of those 1lb tube ground round so I fried up another 1 pound and added that. It looked great like just enough rice to meat ratio. The recipe said 3 cans tomato soup and it's equivalent of water. I assumed this meant 3 cans water. After 50 min baking and removing the foil, the cabbage was about 95% tender.The taste was there but the casserole came out too soupy. Maybe the missing rice caused it to be thin but you'd think that cooked rice wouldn't absorb anymore liquid anyway. I'd do this again cause it WAS easier than real cabbage rolls but I'd use the adjusted amounts of meat and rice and only use 1.5 cans water instead of 3. Hope this helps anyone who likes more meat than rice in thier ""unrolled"" cabbage rolls.",neutral

"The cookies tasted very good.I did have some difficulties with assembling them.I used 1 box (30 cookies) of Keebler brand shortbread cookies as the base.Working with the caramel and coconut topping was difficult.I couldn't get it to stick to the cookie.Be careful with the topping because it is very hot and you have to work quickly with it before it starts to cool down. The recipe probably made double the amount of topping that was really needed. I think the Samoa cookies have a thin layer of the caramel and coconut topping but my cookies have a big, round glob on the top. I probably won't make these again, unless specifically asked to, because of the amount of work involved in them.",neutral
Very flavorful dish that turned out quite dry after 5 hours on low setting in crock pot. Next time around I will definitely increase liquid from the recommended 1/4 cup to at least 3/4 cup.,neutral

"I liked it because it was fast and healthy, but it was a bit dry and bland.I did add a tomato and that helped, and it was much improved when I tossed some mild salsa on top of the dish.I think next time I will also use taco seasoning as a spice.The cloves aren't a good idea because you have to hunt and dig thru the beans to find them so no one accidentaly eats them.I would make it again tho, as it was healthy, fast, easy, and overall good to eat...just a few additions.",neutral

"I have a 5 qt. crockpot and used a 5lb. boneless chuck roast, which I cut into smaller chunks to fit better in the pot. I added carrots and potatoes to the bottom and sides of the pot and used all of the seasonings( I rubbed half of them directly onto the meat as some reviewers said and sprinkled the rest over it.) I also added a little more water to cover the meat a bit more. I cooked this for 9 hours and the results were a very tender roast and not at all salty. I thickened the gravy like recommended.To do this I removed the meat and vegs, added a corn starch and water mix to the pot and it was great! My whole family loved this meal and it's a keeper! Thank You Yooper for this great recipe!",neutral
"It's a winner! Hubby loved it. I felt like it was missing something, but I can't put my finger on it (too salsa tasting maybe). Overall tho, it was a very tasty entree. I served this meal with Green Chili Rice by Karen from Colorado. UPDATE: We had these again last night, but without the Green Chili Rice.They weren't as good as last week - or at least in my opinion - which is why I changed my rating from a 4 to a 3.My DH still liked them, but I really wasn't crazy about them.I'm not sure I would put salsa on my chops anymore (I wanted to bring out the chips), but I will continue to make this for the hubby.Perhaps it was the Green Chili Rice that I served as a side dish that made me like this recipe last week.",neutral
My experience with this roast was a little disappointing. I followed the recipe to the letter other than adding some veggies for the last 3 hours of cooking. The roast was dry and didn't taste much different than the roast I usually make in the crockpot with salt and pepper as seasoning. I will probably try this again with less of the seasonings (as others have suggested) and maybe I will make the juice more of a gravy by adding browned flour when it is done.,neutral
"Sorry, but this recipe was not what we expected.With all the rave reviews, I figured I better try it.We ate it, but no one would eat the left overs.It was tender so I gave it one star for that, but it was too sweet for us.I think I'll stick with the way I do my crockpot pork chops - I pour cream of mushroom soup over them and sometimes add an evelope of dry onion soup mix.They come out just as tender and then we have a wonderful gravy to eat over our mashed potatoes.",negative

"The last thing that I would describe this dish as is a barbeque.If you are looking for that zingy, spicy taste associated with barbeque look for another recipe.The only way I could serve this was to add much more barbeque sauce and hot sauce after the meat was done.Definitely not a keeper in our household.",negative
Too sweet.Basically meatloaf with beans and more of a babecue sauce.It's an OD of sugar- so cut back.Also more bay leaves and a little chili powder can pique it up a little.,neutral
"This was quite an easy recipe to follow however I would change the glaze portion.I added some powdered sugar to the reserved glaze to brush on after baking.This made all the difference.These don't keep very long and with the sweetened glaze, they won't have to!",neutral
Directions were extremly hard to follow... I ruined the night because I added the puding mix with the cake mix... need to work on the instructions...,negative
I doubled the meatball part and used Bertoli roasted garlic and onion spaghetti sauce. It tasted good but the bread on the bottom was mostly soggy. If you can get past the soggy bread then you should like this recipe. Don't think I'd make this again. One thing I did learn from this is that meatballs with green onions instead of regular onions tastes better. No egg required for your meatballs too.,neutral
"I am giving this recipe 3 stars because it wasn't too difficult to make and the carmels turned out smooth and creamy.HOWEVER,the butter flavor was way too overpowering for my family's taste.If you like a strong butter flavor (butter carmels) then this recipe would be a great one to try.",neutral

"My wife and I made this recipe exactly as shown above. While it is true that it had a velvety texture, the flavor was terrible.We thoroughly rinsed the beef and even set it on a timer while soaking and yet could detect the baking soda in the flavor. Also the way the flour is added makes everything taste a little like flour.We cannot understand the 5 star ratings. I could not reccomend this to anyone. Save your ingredients for another recipe.",negative
makes three pints-seeded peppers to reduce the heat.just had enough liquid-maybe another 1/2 cup vinegar?,neutral
Interesting but lacks depth; probably because there is no salt in the recipe. I didn't do the last step (putting it over the coals) because I wasn't grilling anything. Next time I will play around with the seasonings -- maybe add some Sambal to it for a kick.,neutral

"These were fine, but not much different from cooked carrots. Everyone ate them. Perhaps the ho hum attitude was due to the fact that I also served garlic chicken so that any flavour in the carrots was lost.",neutral

This was super easy to make but I didn't think it was anything exceptional.I liked it and will probably make it again but I don't agree with the ratings of 'outstanding'.,neutral
"Nice taste, but the cooking times produced mushy, overdone carrots. Next time I'll just barely blanche them.",neutral
"As a salad dressing, I found this a bit too tangy for my tastes and felt the lime gave it a touch too much sourness. I also felt like it needed a few more seasonings - perhaps even some poppy seeds or herbs.I would also add more honey next time.",neutral

I agree with Marie - this recipe is difficult. It was tasty however so I have adapted into a cookie bar recipe... Look up Samoa Supreme Cookie Bars.,neutral
"Definitely too much fat as is. I'd use less butter and perhaps less cheese? (even though I love both!). When the cheese melts, it adds its own oils to the mix, and the main comments from my non-health conscious family were all about the amount of grease in the casserole. Of course, we haven't had Cracker Barrel's version to compare it to, either.",neutral
"Bergy, wonderful concept but it just didn't work out very well. I will try it again making some changes because it'shas great potential. While the milk, amazingly cooked down to a cream gravy without curdling, I had to remove the chicken and simmer the milk an extra 15 minutes to reduce the sauce. The result was a bland chicken andbland gravy overpowered by a sweet flavor from the milk. If at first you don't succeed, try, try again!*^-^*",neutral
"I appreciate the simplicity of this recipe, but I find it just wasn't quite to my taste.Thank you for the simple idea, though, as I hope to try and find a tomato marinade that I can make up on my own.",neutral
Potatoes were creamy; pork was tender. Husband and I must be tired of mushroom soup because we kind of thought it was boring.,neutral

"Well as I said in the post concerning this salad I was dissappointed that it wasn't better received at our school's potluck. Hubby's job was to gather a honest review of the salad, and for the most part it came back as being accepted as average. I sometimes think that not all dishes get a fair shake at ""potluck"" simply because you can have such a variety of flavors that may simply clash, and I think that in all fairness that could be part of what happened here. I am submitting a picture in gratitude for your suggesting this easy salad, and I must add on the plus side that I did like the idea of making this the night before and then giving it that 1/2 hour of ""warm up"" time making it ideal in that respect for potluck.",neutral
I wasn't overly impressed. I used smaller potatoes so perhaps they should have only been sliced in half. I would experiment with different spices if I made this again.,neutral

I wasn't sure what size pudding box to use so I used a large size box.I made it the night before a school potluck, refrigerated it, but by the time I served it, the twinkies had absorbed all of the strawberry juice and turned to mush. I brought home 3/4th of the 9 x 13"" pan.I guess my recommendation would be to make this only a couple of hours in advance so that the twinkies don't get mushy.",neutral
Not enough information even for the experienced canner.Just what is jello crystals?Used the non flavored knox gelation.Only got 7 8oz. jelly jars.Do you have to process?How long??Would like to try this again. [Editor's Note: the recipe was updated as a result of this comment 9/17/2002],negative
"Yummy, though the crushed tomatoes dominated the taste much more than I expected.I'd like to try this with a smaller can of diced tomatoes, rather than the larger can of crushed, so that the other flavors can shine -- I tripled the spices and the sauce still tasted more of tomatoes than I'd prefer.",neutral

"This dipping sauce can be used for Japanese pot stickers (gyoza), spring rolls and certain types of white raw fish (sashimi or otsukuri).There is really no substitute for fresh ginger (tubes are 2nd choice).You can use an asian grinder or a european zester and 'squeeze' out the ginger juice to avoid eating too much pulp if you wish.You can also add a bit of chili oil if you want a little heat.'Roasted' dried fish flakes will add a savoury and sweet dimension.Lemon/lime juice or zest is also very refreshing!Tip: most Japanese people eat raw fish simply dipped into special 'sashimi' soy sauce and just a little ground Japanese horseradish, which is green in colour and expensive as hell, called 'wasabi'.I think the reason why Benihana uses Onions in their ginger dipping sauce is because it goes well with the oily, savoury and hot-plate fried foods that they typically serve at a Teppanyaki house.",neutral
This dish did not remind me of pierogies.The bottom layer of noodles got very chewy.I think it needs something in the bottom of the pan before placing the noodles.Maybe some of the butter mixture.The fat content is a little high for my diet also.I tried reducing the butter and cheese and did not serve with sour cream.It is rather plain this way.Maybe if I used reduced fat sour cream it would help.,neutral
"This was very tasty dish, however, I found that despite the fact that the baking sheet was sprayed gererously with non-cooking spray, the coating on the chicken stuckto the pan.The chicken, instead of the golden brown colour I expected, was quite dark in some spots, almost black which made it less apealing at the dinner table. I agree, the chicken itself and the pan need to be sprayed quite liberaly with the non-cooking spray.",neutral
We were not impressed with this dessert and will not make it again.,neutral

"I'm sorry Mirj. This one didn't work out too well. I ended up baking it way longer than called for to get the sweet potatoes where I get get a fork into them, and by that time, the apples had gotten too mushy (and I did use the Cortlands). I did try tasting it, the apples had a flavor of lemon (even with the cider in the pan), and were a bit tart. I tried sprinkling with some cinnamon and nutmeg and drizzling honey over it all, and that did help tone that down some, and bring out some flavor. I think maybe the apples should be cut larger (in wedges) and those sweet potatoes cut thin, and do prepare for some honey or brown sugar on the apples at least. I think maybe that could help this recipe work.",neutral

Ok maybe it's just my tastes. I was only going to give 2 stars but my mother in law really liked them alot so I gave it another star. She even had another serving which is unheard of.

I think I would like to try it with less fat and flour. It was much too thick for me.,neutral
"I made this fruit dip for my Hawaiian Luau party.The dip was really great, although I don't think people knew what it was by looking at it.So, not much of it was actually eaten.In the bowl it basically looks like vanilla pudding.Next time, I make it, I think I will print a sign that says, ""Hawaiian Fruit Dip"".I used the 1/3 less fat sour cream and skim milk.It didn't seem to affect the taste.It was good!",neutral
"To make things easier, I bought a bag of frozen mixed fruit at Sams Club let it thaw for about 45 minutes, and then combined it with the sauce.I should have read over the recipe better, because I didn't realize how long the sauce would take to cool and was stretched for time.",neutral
"This was pretty okay, but the maple flavour didn't really come through as I'd hoped. The ginger was pretty strong, and the soy sauce didn't seem to add too much to the dish. I halved the recipe and followed it to the T. Maybe I should try this with honey!",neutral
"This was a little too sweet for my liking. I used strawberry marmalade instead of orange, because that's all I had on hand. I liked the idea of baking the bananas, but I think this would taste better without the sugar and maybe some more lemon. I'd like to try this with with chocolate syrup instead of the marmalade too.",neutral

"Horrible, bad, awful, poorly written recipe!Ok, was I clear enough?AMBER is NOT a stage in cooking sugar!I tried this recipe twice. The first time I kept cooking and cooking the sugar waiting for it to get ""amber"" which it never did.The sugar seized up.Ok, there was 5 cups of sugar wasted.So I tried again and cooked it to firm ball stage, which seemed logical to me.It was gritty and never set. Another 5 cups of sugar wasted, plus cream and butter.It *could* have been the humidity (as I live in Texas, afterall), but I do believe that an actual cook-to temperature would have been highly helpful instead of ""AMBER"". Grrr!",negative
"I made this but maybe I did something wrong because I couldnt understand the water after you browned everything in a pan, it just drowned everything and was very watery, I followed the directions exactly.After I drained it it was good but I just didnt understand what the water was for.It was still good though. Thanks!",neutral
"I'll give you an A+ on that title, it's really creative. As for the carrots, I'm not so enthusiastic. They had an odd taste, perhaps because they were overly oily. Although simple looking in composition, the flavors did not do well with all the oil. Sorry.",neutral

I agree with some of the other comments already made.I gave one star because the chops were tender.Not a big hit with any member of the family.No one ate the leftovers.,negative
It was nice. It didn't taste like beef stew but it was worth trying it. I will make it again.,neutral
"This drink holds some promise if the ratios are reworked, I think. Right now, as it is, the lemon juice is the defining flavor, and overcomes the Kahlua and even all taste of the grenadine is lost. I can see the makings of a relative of the Scorpion in it with coffee instead of almond; it just didn't quite make it.",neutral
"Sorry, I did not care for these. I thought I would like them because of all the indredients in them, but I think it was too much cream cheese.

"This was nice, if a bit too ""strong"" tasting. The celery probably needed something bland like peas or potatoes to even out the flavour in the recipe. I scaled down to 1 serving and used a combination of paprika, garlic powder, oregano and dried dill instead of the chicken stock cube, as I'm vegetarian. I used regular milk and added 1/8 tsp of salt as well. Since the recipe didn't mention where to add the milk, I assumed it was immediately after adding the flour and stirring, and that worked alright. I didn't puree the mixture as I wanted a chunky soup, but maybe pureeing would have helped ease out the flavours a bit.",neutral

"I don't want to argue about the taste or quality of this recipe, but it is included in the section for diabetics and as such fully unusefull.The fruits contains high quantities of sugar and on top of that honey is added, a direct source of glucose, exactly the type of sugar diabetics must avoid.",negative
"Made it, looked great, but it was like sweet and sour without the sour.I didn't add the corn.",negative
"The flavor was good, but a bit too salty. I will eliminate the added salt next time. 2 c. of ham was plenty. Also, I agree that the sauce was soup-like and too liquid. I haven't decided whether or not to reduce the added water next time. Very filling and economical, also easy. I served it alone, but a green veggie would balance it nicely.",neutral
"This was pretty okay for a quick and easy dinner, but I felt the vinegar overpowered all the other flavours. The chickpeas seemed a little out of place among the italian herbs and tomatoes, but the garlic added a lot of flavour. I'd like to give this a shot with some oregano, paprika, and maybe even some cumin.",neutral
Ground beef?!?Obviously no idea what SOS is.,negative
"This is a very nice sauce and was very easy to prepare, as well as very quick.The directions were very clear and accurate.The taste was good, but didn't quite suit our tastes.I felt the peppers and the thyme were very pronounced, and even though I love those two ingredients, they overwhelmed the sauce for me.This, unfortunately didn't go over as well with my family as I had hoped.",neutral
"These rolls tasted very good when they were finally done, but the problem was that it took a lot longer for them to rise than was posted in the recipe book.We ended up having them for a ""post-dinner"" addition.I would recommend these rolls to others, but make sure you leave plenty of time for rising!",neutral
I thought it tasted okay but my kids didn't care for it. A bit too much work for the end result.,neutral
"This was nice, but didn't have too much body. I followed all the instructions and did add any cream or arrowroot or tomato paste, but I probably should've added some arrowroot because this was a little too watery. Also the oil/butter floating around the top of the soup didn't make it look too appetising. However this was good when soaked up with crusty garlic bread.",neutral
"I reduced this down to 50 servings and made it yesterday. I used upto 8tsps. of this in 1 mug of boiling water. However, I still felt it required more sugar. I'll add more next time. Maybe that should help it improve.",neutral
"I've tried a variety cookies over the years. Did not like this one at all. Too overpowering coffee taste, maybe back it down to one Tblsp or 2 tsp. Just didn't make the grade for me.",negative
"This was very good except the directions were unclear on what kind of cheese, bake uncovered or covered and what size casserole to use. I made two casseroles one with parmesan and mozarella cheese and one with just parmesan.They were both good but my family still prefers the traditional green beans casserole but a nice change.",neutral
This was easy to make. Just throw together and forget it til dinner.But I didnt like it enough to make it again.,neutral
"Yes, this was an easy soup to mak. Although, I was hoping for more taste!I added a bit of thyme to bring out some more flavor. all in all it was ok. ",neutral
"I made this at 5:30 pm today. Now, nearly 8 hours later, the peanut mixture is still not hardened. It tastes sweet and nice, no doubt, but it did not harden. However, I had also made another batch but in a slightly different way that turned out amazingly good. I used 1 1/2 cups peanuts, 1/2 cup sugar and 2 tsps. margarine(You can also use butter instead of margarine). I combined all these in a heavy skillet and cooked over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the sugar was melted and golden in colour, and, the nuts were toasted. It took about 7-8 minutes. Then, I spread the peanuts on an aluminium foil, allowed it to cool and after sometime, I separated them.It was over in no time. Do try it this way, you'll love them.",neutral
"I tried this recipe yesterday. I didn't agree with the cooking time. No way near 20 minutes @ 350! For teaspoonful size cookie max was 10 minutes -- and this made a very small cookie. I use cookie dough scoops and the tsp size made just a small ""pop in the mouth"" size cookie. For the 2nd batch I used a Tblsp size scoop and increase time to 11 minutes. This gave much more flavorful cookie and a decent size. You need a larger cookie to really taste the ingredients. It's not a sweet tasting cookie but still a nice flavored applesauce cookie.I used craisins instead of raisins.",neutral
"This recipe is sweet.I brought this to a group function, and those with sweet tooths were in heaven, while the rest of us thought it was a bit overdone.If you like your desserts sweet, you might give this s try!",neutral
This made a quick main dish by using leftover rice and baked chiken. I'll be using this recipe a lot.,neutral
"Sorry Dale! this just didn't cut it. It was very bland, not a lot of taste.I did cut the recipe in half, but I don't think that made any difference.It was edible, it just didn't have much taste. I think the coconut milk overpowered everything else. Perhaps a half a can was too much, there was an awful lot of sauce. Another time I would add more seasoning, herbs or something and cut the sauce in half again.",neutral
"I'm sorry to say that I didn't really care for this frosting.I too, used it to frost a dark chocolate cake.It was easy to make, but to us, the taste of the flour came through, more than the vanilla.The idea is a great one--less sweet frosting is what really appealed to me,though I think that using flour may not be the way to go.",neutral

Quite good.Garnish with grated cheddar and nacho sliced peppers.Serve over English muffins.,neutral
"Tasted good.We like a bit more spice, so we left the seeds in.Needed more onionflavor though.",neutral
"I made this for a special Sunday breakfast. I found it took a lot longer to cook than the time in the recipe.It did have good flavour though and I liked the fact that it was a one-skillet meal, and as with most of Emeril's dishes, it was definitely ""kicked up"" . Would make this again, but definitely only as an occasional treat, because of the high fat content. Thanks for sharing.",neutral
"texture is good, but needs a little more mint flavor.",neutral
"This was nice, but a little too buttery for my liking. The taste of the soy sauce didn't really come through so I had to add some more, so I ended up with a little pool of sauce at the bottom of the dish. The sesame seeds did add a nice touch.",neutral

"Whew! An extremely filling and nutritious breakfast, but it was a bit too much for me. I halved the recipe and made this in the microwave. I boiled water on HIGH for 3 minutes, and then added 1/8 teaspoon salt (according to package instructions) and oatmeal and cooked for an additional 3 minutes, stirring approximately every 45 seconds. After adding the spices and apple, I cooked for another minute. I omitted the ginger since I'm not too fond of it. I had to use a ""sweet"" apple because we don't get Granny Smiths here, and so it ended up a bit too sweet for me.",neutral
"I made this for dinner tonight. I substituted the fresh cream with low-fat plain yogurt and the butter with cooking oil. I'm sorry, it didnt turn out as I'd expected. I cooked it in the microwave on HIGH for 18-20 minutes more than the stated time , i.e., after step 6. The French beans were still uncooked. The carrots were about 3/4th cooked. The red chilli powder did give it some taste, but, on the whole, the dish left alot desired...May I suggest to boil the French beans and carrots separately on the stove until they are 3/4th cooked, before tossing them into the dish - i.e., step 2.Also, I'd use a whole cup of yogurt in future instead of just 1/2 cup.This is a nice dish, just requires that the French beans be cooked completely before serving it.",neutral
"I baked the cake an extra 10 minutes and it was still just a gooey mess.Impossible to cutin presentable slices.I think the cream cheese mixture has way too much melted butter, maybe half a stick would be better.The cream cheese, butter and powdered sugar mix was very runny.I put the leftovers in the refrigerator and when cold it was somewhat easier to slice and actually tasted a little better too.The look was one horrible mess though.Do not serve this when you want to make an impression on guests.I was going to throw it in the garbage but guests convinced me to try to get it on the plates.",negative
"Although we enjoyed this recipe, I think that I should have cooked the dish longer than the 20 minutes specified because the rice was not completely absorbed in that amount of time. ",neutral

The problems that I had with this recipe were probably my fault when I doubled the recipe. The mayo taste was too strong for my family's taste.,neutral
"For this recipe, I used Italian blend cheese since it was the only kind I had.I also served it with fried rice and the combination was nice. It's a nice base, mild flavored recipe if you're serving it with something that has a bold flavor.I wouldn't recommend serving it alone because it is slightly bland.However, again, I didn't use cheddar cheese which might have really flavored it up alot.All in all, it's a good recipe and I'll probably make it again.Give it a try!

"Well I'm afraid I didn't have a lot of success with this Currant loaf.It turned out like a cement brick.I did add a little more of the tea to loosen it up some, the dough was soo dry, it wouldn't hold together. And there is no oven temperature indicated, so I baked it at 350f degrees, watched it closely and took it out at about 45 minutes.It is edible, the taste is reasonable, but very hard and dry.Good for dunkin' in coffee.( I did get your answer, for the oven temp. but too late 325f degrees.)",neutral
I'm not sure what I did wrong but I made this recipe twice this summer and followed the directions to a tee.Both batches resulted in very weak brined pickles that ended up going to waste -even after a 6 week wait.By far the easiest dill pickle recipe I've ever come across though.,neutral
"I made two batches one following all the instructions except that I sprinkled the top with cinnamon instead of nutmeg as I am not a real nutmeg fan except with eggnog. The other one I substituted Splenda for the sugar and added a teaspoon of orange extract. Well, the original recipe turned out to be a greasy mess. The crust turned brown and felt and tasted like it had been fried. The crust was absolutely oil saturated (I used a pre-made frozen Pet-Ritz crust so it was not a crust recipe problem.) The filling was very oily too, like the butter was not thoroughly incorporated in the filling and was oozing out. The Splenda version had the same problem with the crust being saturated in grease, but the butter absorbed nicely into the filling so that version was edible if I left the crust behind. It seems like all it is, is fat. Cream and half and half are pretty much just butterfat and then 3 tablespoons of additional butter is dotted on top. It's no wonder the grease had no place else to go but the crust. My understanding is that this is supposed to turn out very gooey like a pecan pie but it didn't quite turn out like that for me. BTW the Splenda version came closer to a custard like a coconut custard pie without the coconut. Unfortunately the crust still ended up too oily to eat. My oven is running a bit touchy with heat settings and am getting a new one in a couple of weeks. On the off chance this had anything to do with my experience, I would try this again if someone else tries it and has satisfactory results. ",negative
"The rating on this was an average between myself and my husband.I have not had cardamom (except in chai teas), and was very much intrigued by these little babies.The flavour is so unique... I made these very small, and they were wonderfully nutty, with the barest hint of fruit to provide a note of sweet contrast.I should add that when I was processing these, they didn't really seem to firm up, or become paste-like, so I did add about 1 Tablespoon of flour.My husband was not impressed at all.He thought they were dry, lacking in flavour, and I think really the problem is that he was looking to fix his 'sweet' tooth craving.4 from me, 2 from him.These go great with chai tea, by the way.",neutral

It was just right for the kids with ketchup, and I added some Cholula (like Tabasco only better) and ketchup. Good easy dish!",neutral
"This was very good but I probably wouldn't make it again for the following reasons:1.Any beef roast is really excellent in the crockpot - just add onion, garlic, salt and pepper, and you just can't beat it.Why go thru the expense of buying 3 packets of mix.I always make my own salad dressing w/olive oil and vinegar so don't normally buy Italian dressing or Ranch dressing mix, or gravy mix either, for that matter.2.There was a ""sharp"" taste - was it the Italian dressing?I don't know.But, honestly, it was good.",neutral

"Sorry Ann, but this was way to lemony and salty for us. Russell cooked dinner, and as a first time preserved lemon user, he just put it in pulp and all. That, the juice and the olives over-powered the other flavors. I think the lemon pulp needed to removed, and the juice needed to be reduced to a couple of tablespoons. It was also difficult to get the 1/3 cup flour to adhere to the chicken pieces once coated with the spice/cilantro mix. Maybe they could have been mixed with the flour and done in one step.

"This was very pretty to look at, easy to prepare, and tasted good.I did use the tripack noodles with the seasoning packet and did not add any additional ingredients(although I did use some of the optional ingredients suggested by the recipe poster- namely extra veggies in place of the cabbage and I did add the mirin).The noodles didn't heat up much in the microwave, so I cooked them just a tiny bit longer.I think I would definitely prefer to cook them according to the package directions first next time - in liquid, then drain off the water before using.I think the optional splash of mirin is a key ingredient as it adds some much needed moisture to the dish.Next time, I will use fresh garlic rather than the powdered, and follow some of the suggestions mentioned by SueL in her review of this same dish.",neutral

"This recipe’s shining glory is its simplicity and ease of preparation. But although the directions are as clear as a bell, the ingredient list’s waters are a little muddy – I just find it completely illogical to use a liquid measurement for a dry ingredient such as bread cubes (how on earth does one account for the large volume of air in 2 quarts of bread cubes?). The dish was, as expected, extremely rich due to the dairy and chocolate content, and the chocoholics in the household were greatly appreciative of that. However, the rum flavour was barely detectable and that was a tremendous disappointment. If I make this recipe again, I will cut back a tad on the cream and increase the rum – or, perhaps, add some rum extract. Although this recipe was far from being up to the authoring chef’s usual high standards and by no means merits the exaggeration of the descriptive “ultimate”, its substandard quality will not deter me, nor should it deter you, from preparing her other recipes as I have made quite a few of her other creations, most of which have been absolutely excellent.",neutral

This was anice alternate to scalloped potatoes. I used peameal bacon and it was good.,neutral

After I mixed this up I did not have time to put it on the grill.SO...I marinated the chickenin the refrig. for over night.Big mistake on my part!! The flavor was over powering.I think I'd also like to try a low sodium soy sauce if I fix this again. ,neutral

If you have enough liquid to cover a 2lb roast, you can't reduce it in 10 minutes. My veg were cooked and we wanted to eat, so I poured some thin liquid over the cooling meat just so we could eat.

Another time, I think I'll mix the melted butterscotch immediately with the oil, which shouldn't be harmed by the heat, to try to keep it liquid.I hope that also prevents the butterscotch from sinking to the bottom of the batter, which made the cake stick to the pan big-time, even though I had used nonstick spray.",neutral

So, I suggest boiling the chickpeas before anything else, or this one omission, can make the whole soup a disaster(I unfortunately forgot to boil the chickpeas and my soup wasn't as good as I could've made it). I omitted the olive oil - there was nothing to fry here, no seasoning,etc, so I didnt feel it was necessary to have any oil in this recipe, and, I also dislike seeing the oil float on top of a completed soup, I wouldn't touch it, so, I left the oil out. I don't have dried sage, so, I used dried basil as a substitute. I omitted the salt since the broth already contains enough salt in it.

"This took much longer than thirty minutes to cook.I also had to add more beans.I added chili beans, which altered the orginal flavor, so I had to add diff. spices.Anyhow, the flavor before adding the other beans was good.I don't like I'll make it again though.",neutral
"These really weren't what I expected from all the rave reviews.The corn flake crumbs didn't stick well and they tasted alright.I even marinated the chicken for a few hours!They were, however, very easy to make.I did like that factor.So if you're in a hurry for dinner and want something fast, then I think this recipe would work well.",neutral

"This is a tough call...I can honestly break my review down like this:Taste 5 starsEase 4 stars Appearance 1 starMy muffin tin is non-stick, but only 2 came out intact.Intact they looked like a mini-muffin that didn't fully rise.The texture seemed undecided (I know - I'm weird) like it was a conglomeration of a cookie and candy trying to pass off as a muffin!I even tried rolling the dough around the Rolo and baking it on a sheet which helped, but then it just melded together to make a very rich gooey cookie.For ease I only gave it 4 stars because I didn't like having to unwrap the Rolo's!All in all, just not for me but might be good for a youngster to make.Thanks young Dorn for sharing and keep on trying new things - just like your Mom!!!!

"This was okay.The taste was fine and it was definitely better than we expected for canned vegetables.We like crisper vegetables but I had these cans of asparagus that I needed to use for something.I didn't add the eggs as I didn't have any hardboiled ones, wasn't making them and my family doesn't really like them.No tabasco sauce either as there was none in the house and I decided not to use any of my husband's many habanero pepper based sauces.The cans of asparagus that I used were 15 oz each and a can of cream of celery soup was 10 3/4 oz each.I used 2 cups of cheddar cheese.I may make this again but will try it with fresh asparagus.",neutral

"This is a very confusing recipe! I omitted the green pepper and onion because the recipe doesn't state what to do with them. Also, what type of pork roast was not stated - my boneless pork loin would have burned to a crisp using the roasting directions in the recipe. It was done after 40 min. at 325'!

"I did manage to make these successfully but with a few modifications in the quantities of certain ingredients. I used 3/4 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup of cocoa powder instead of 1/8 cup.

"It tastes good,But I had a hard time with it.I think maybe it should be whipped before adding the walnuts. I just don`t know.I did work fast.But it just seemed to harden to fast!Or even skip the whipping part!!!!!!!You may laugh at me but I buttered an other cookie sheet and put it on top then stepped on it using my weight to spread it out.There was no way I could have stretched it out.!!",neutral
"I was fasting all through today and I made this for evening prayers as 'prasad' and then broke my fast with it. I liked it even though I had halved the recipe and used 1 whole cup of water to cook the rice. Unfortunately, the 1/4 cup rice I used did not cook sufficiently in 1 cup of water. I was helpless as I was fasting and I couldn't taste the rice to check if it was cooked or not. I proceeded with adding the jaggery and with the remaining steps. Made the payasam and served it as prasad to everyone. Only when I tasted it did I realise that I hadn't cooked the rice perfectly. The pudding is tasty even though the rice is 3/4th cooked. I like it, honestly. However, mom and dad didn't like it, because of the rice not being completely cooked. I'm going to add some water and cook the completed payasam in a while on the stove, and, I'll probably review once again if I manage to make it a success. But I must tell you that as a prasad, after my 'Sinful and heavenly divine semolina halwa', this is really good, IMO.",neutral

"Not bad, but not good.A little bland, and too smooth from putting everything in the blender.Also not especially creamy in my opinion (used to canned soups).Maybe setting aside some of the broccoli before blending, and using soy creamer instead of soymilk could help?Probably won't make again...",neutral

"I think these muffins have a lot of potential, but I could barely taste the corn or the apples.

They were okay but I felt there was too much sauce.I think this recipe needs a little help.It didn't get rave reviews when I served them last night.,neutral
"I made the recipe as directed, and doubled the amount of marinade, as the chef suggested.The dish smelled wonderful as it was cooking, but when we actually tried it, it didn't seem to quite live up to the lovely aroma.Not sure if the consistency of the cornstarch-based sauce, or maybe the lemon, honey, and soy sauce combination ratio didn't satisfy our taste buds.It just wasn't quite what we expected based on the ingredients and the great cooking smells.",neutral
Poor directions on the fruits.Are the lemons-lemon zest or juice? Same thing for the pineapples.,negative

"Sorry, sweet Dana, but I had problems with this recipe. It's too wet and sticky. I think the proportions are incorrect. I think it has too much butter and/or maybe you don't need to add the milk. I tried really hard with it to make it work but the dough is too soft and sticky to roll out or roll in a log, even after being refrigerated overnight. I was able to make drop cookies with it, though, after I froze it in the freezer. The cookies taste really yummy. Soft and puffy with a nice vanilla flavor with just a hint of nutmeg.",neutral

"I wasn't as thrilled with this dish as I thought I'd be, but I did use turkey sausage instead of the ham.",neutral
"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this recipe.The cream cheese and sour cream mixture was overpowering and covered the taste of the chicken. I ended up adding two (10 oz) cans of chicken and you still could not taste it. Also added toasted pine nuts, 1/2 tsp of granule chicken bouillon and black pepper. The people at the party liked the dip - but asked if it was tuna or chicken.",negative

"I doubled this recipe last night and made this for dinner. I omitted the Tabasco sauce altogether as we don't use it. I used Maggi vegetable stock with onions as a substitute for the chicken stock. The major problem with doubling the recipe came when blindly I added the juice of 4 lemons instead of 2 to the soup. I had not tasted the soup before serving. It was too strong in lemon and my family was MAD at me:( I had to add almost 2 cups of water and boil again to make it ok. I'm sorry for giving such a review, but mom gave me one bad time that night.",neutral
"I excitedly tried these with my family the other night and I am not sure what I did wrong, but they were bland.

"I would not reccomend this recipe.If left out of the freezer to serve, even for five minutes, these ""cheesecakes"" become mush.Also, the sweetened condensed milk gave them a funny taste.

"This is pretty good, however, my oven took only about 45 minutes for it to be thoroughly done at 375*.I put in fair sized chunks of apple, however, I think that very small or even grated apple would be better for this.Overall, a fair recipe- just a little tweaking needed and it makes a very moist and yummy bread.",neutral

"I had a jar of Branston's in the cupboard so I decided to try this recipe.It is a long preparation process but worth every minute for the results.I did change this around a bit by cutting back on the sugar; eliminating the zucchini, mustard seeds and allspice and increased the juice of 1 lemon, and used one small bottle of kitchen bouquet to get it the same color as the jar I had. The jar ingredients includes tomato, so I used approximately 1/2 c. ketchup. It seemed to take about 3 hr. of simmering for the rutabaga to soften to the tooth.The end result was an amazing clone of the original.If you love pickle, you'll love this!Thanks for posting this recipe.",neutral

The pork chops were pretty good, but the remaining sauce was still too limey, even with the reduced amount, so I served the pork chops without it. Basically an average recipe and not something I would make again. ",neutral
I decided to make this for aquick and easy Friday night dinner for my toddler and myself. I live in the tropics so I used kangkong [Asian spinach] instead of the usual spinach. This may have been a mistake as kangkong is a little more bitter. Instead of lemon juice I used lime in the amounts specified by the recipe. The pine nuts are a good idea as it needs something to give it a slightly sweet touch. Just needs more. I would probably try out flaked almonds once my toddler is old enough.I also like heaps of better on my couscous. Actually my preference is for it to be semi-saturated with butter because 1. couscous can be very dry by its nature and 2. I like the taste of a good NZ butter and 3. I'm a dairy farmer's daughter ;-).So I would prefer more fat in what is an extremely low fat dish.There's something missing though and I'm not 100% sure what. Next time I will probably try dissolving a stock cube in the water and Massel produce some good vegan chicken tasting ones.To me it is a 2 star recipe because I'm a hard marker. The 3rd star is because my 20 month old decided she would have a couple of bites despite not being hungry at all. I would not abandon this recipe however. It is a good start and it is quite edible. It just lacks the pizzazz that would make me keen to make it on a regular basis or have me going back for umpteen repeats until I am absolutely full.,neutral
"I made these twice and I could not get them to set up.The second time I let the mixture get darker amber, thinking that was the reason.I did go onto Gail Gand's web page and the recipe is correct as written.I am not sure what the problem is...they taste fabulous (not gritty at all) but are too sticky and gooey and won't hold their shape (even after letting them firm up overnight).I think I may try freezing them and then cutting and dipping in chocolate.Maybe that will hold them together?I think this has potential since the flavor is so good...maybe a temperature would help?P.S.I used light cream, since the recipe does not specify and I did warm it.It took 10-15 minutes WITHOUT stirring to get the sugar to the amber color and do be careful when adding the butter and cream...the sugar goes crazy and bubbles all over ",neutral
"I'm afraid I'll have to agree with Bill. While this didn't seem bland to me (parmesan cheese DOES add a lot of flavour), I couldn't really discern any special broccoli-stem flavour in this. But I like the idea of using the stems grated, and I may try this with a whole bunch of spices and herbs added.",neutral
"I'mnot sure what I did wrong here but this bread stuffed up. However it was a very nice tasting bread and my toddler liked it hence the 3 stars.Now I can make 750 g or 1 kg loaves in my breadmaker. This recipe is on the big side. I find that one cup of water [250 ml] is a bit dry in my breadmaker and I get the best results with 350-400 ml. I suspect this is the reason that the dough formed a ball in the bottom of the pan and baked that way - it was too thick.This loaf doesn't taste cheesy at all. While it smelt cheesy while it was cooking, I was surprised that I couldn't taste the cheddar [and I used an excellent 'real' cheddar] once it was done.Instead of butter I used olive oil.So it was a nice bread, but needs more liquid to thin it out [at least for my breadmaker]. Just don't expect a super-cheesy taste.",neutral

"Hmmm... I have heard about grape jelly and chili sauce meatballs, and I made this for a party last week.I substituted ground turkey for the beef.It tasted just like grape jelly to me which wasn't very appetizing.Maybe it's an acquired taste, I know there are a lot of people who love meatballs done this way.I ended up adding a can of tomato sauce and some barbeque sauce and liked it much better.To each his own!Thanks for the recipe, though, I have been wanting to try this out for a long time.",neutral

"I halved this recipe and made this yesterday for lunch to serve as a main dish with hot rotis. I had soaked the chickpeas overnight and I did not go for canned chickpeas. I used 2 1/2 cups of water to bring this to a boil(with reference to step 9 in the recipe) as 1/2 cup was very little - it was more of a dry chole dish with only 1/2 a cup of water.Most importantly, Punjabi food is ""heavily"" spiced up and ""must"" be very ""khatta"" to be authentic Punjabi food. Being the daughter of a Punjabi woman, I can swear that I have eaten alot of Punjabi food and it's always been very ""tikha""(spicy) and ""khatta""(Sorry, I'm not able to get the English word for khatta right now) - these are 2 prime requirements for a dish to be called a Punjabi dish other than it being bursting with flavour! This recipe uses a minimum of all the spices and it really wasn't khatta at all and hence the taste was not as I'd expected. I added 1/2 a tsp. more of amchur powder but it didn't work out. My mom told me that her sis makes excellent Punjabi chole and she uses a combo of both amchur powder and tamarind pulp - and she's married to a Punjabi man too and is a pickle expert I'm sorry I'm not able to give 5 stars to this dish, though, personally, I ""did"" like the idea of using only 1/2 a tbsp. of oil in it. It really has to be more spicier and more khatta to be tasty and Punjabi food, both. My mom suggests you add more tamarind pulp and mango(amchur) powder as well as some tomatoes(peeled and chopped) to this to make it really tasty and a meal to remember.",neutral

I found 3/8 cup of sugar to be very less actually. I used 1 cup sugar when I made it. I also used 1 cup milk in addition to 1 cup water. It makes it richer and gives a better consistency. I went a little low on the ghee, using just 1 1/2 tbsps. instead of 2. I'd like to add that when I prepare this, I always first bring the milk and water mixture to a boil and only after that, I add in the sugar and stir occasionally, until the sugar completely dissolves.

The Worcestershire sauce has a predominant flavor in this pate.If you have adventurous eaters who have a more sophisticated palate they will probably like this pate.

The recipe is a little too turkey taste for me .I feel it sauce is to sweet tasting.This recipe is great for low fat diet and low salt diet.,negative
"I thought this dish was too sweet, although my dinner guest enjoyed it. It's definitely worth trying again, but I would cut back on the Amaretto and add broth or cream as the base of the sauce.",neutral
"I made this last night and thought it was good but not great.Maybe my expectations were too high, but it was easy.If I make it again, I think I might put in a little less water.",neutral
It was just okay.I was a little disappointed.,neutral
"Well, I did it. I had a salmon fillet about ¾ lb, so I proportioned ingredients to that. I had already taken the skin off, so that may be a factor.It sat for 72hrs in refrigerator. It does cut well, to a point, and I took the last ½ inch and put in on the grill, after I had taken chicken for some Southwest grilled chicken off. Anyhow, this is good, not quite what I expectedand#8230;more time maybe? More wine and cognac? I like the idea, but not as much as I like smoked lox, or grilled salmon. ",neutral
"This was very good! I was disappointed that I didn't have the garlic and herb tomato soup to use, so instead I ""invented"" by own version by using regular tomato soup and adding a little garlic powder and a random herb or so. I don't think that I added enough of those two to make a difference, but that is ok! It was still very good! I used mini lasagna noodles (cooked them in water for a minute or so to get them going-which make it so a whole 2 1/4 cups of water was not necessary, probably 1 3/4...) Also, I added a little more veggies because I can never get enough of them! What I made served 6 people perfectly. I love it how it was so easy and colorful! Perhaps the beef could be substituted by chicken? Maybe! Well, I am glad I made it and I am sure I will again in the future! Thanks!",neutral
"I decided to try this recipe myself after seeing Mirj's and Inez' discussion regarding it on the boards.Like Mirj, I've really enjoyed Inez' recipes and will be making more of them.Unfortunately, also like Mirj, I had the same problems.I ended up making it a second time and still was not satisfied with the results.Both times I made the recipe as is, but the second time, I baked it sooner as it was mentioned in the discussion that it should not be allowed to raise beyond the top of the bread pan before beginning to bake.It does have a delightful flavor and since I have a toaster/convection oven, I was able to work with the crumbliness the following day by toasting it (when I tried using the uncut loaf the following morning to make DH's sandwiches for work, it tended to crumble apart).This is an extremely quick bread-making recipe so I really wish it would have worked out for me.Thank you for giving me an opportunity to try it though Inez!",neutral
A very quick and tasty icing. Reminds me of my grandmas! ,neutral
This was simple and tasted good for a fast meal. I prefer more sauce next time. I think a little let tortilla's next time I make it. Thanks!,neutral
"Good lowfat rolls. The instructions for this recipe are very clear and produced a dough that was very easy prepare and quite pliable.The flavor of the olive oil is very noticeable though - I am not sure I cared for it in these rolls.The exterior does indeed get quite crisp, and the interior was soft, but not as dense and rich in flavor as expected.I found these to be very similar in texture to refrigerator biscuit dough when cooked, although with a very different flavor. A good recipe,and certainly healthier than other roll recipes,but not a favorite for us.",neutral
"I'm sorry these didn't work out for me. The batter is really yummy and tasty, but, unfortunately, inspite of having made it and freezed it for 3 hours, this did not work out. When baked, these melt and there is a total mess in the cookie tray. Fortunately, I used up only some of the batter. With the rest, I'll make round little balls out of the mixture and freeze them until it's time to serve them. Once out of the freezer, these really have to be eaten fast, or it's a big mess.",neutral
"It was quite tasty, but I found that the amount I used for the Teriyaki sauce made the dish too salty. A cup of the sauce would have been best. I also could have done this with meat like Chicken or Beef (even Fish!). Also, I could have added more veggies to this dish as well.",neutral
"Overall, this was a tasty recipe. The sauce did turn out really thick and most of the cheese melted out of the chicken while cooking, so I'll make some adjustments for next time. ",neutral
"It was very easy to make, but I didn't like the taste. Maybe there are just certain types of bread that would really complement the flavors.",negative
"the prep time is not 5 minutes, and i can mince and dice with the best of them! it was more like 30.soup had a nice flavor, i used extra sharp cheddar, but it needed additional condiments at the table",neutral
Make sure to cook the remaining marinade before brushing on before serving. I would season with salt andpepper before marinading. Also I would add scallions and ginger to the marinade. And finish off under the broiler to crisp up (BBQ).,neutral
"did taste like pizza, but i didnt like it very much. we could eat it, but i wouldnt make it again. sorry!",neutral
"This was my first successful attempt using my new crockpot, so I think some of the problems I had may have been my fault.I used a 6-qt crockpot instead of a 4-quart one and cooked it for 7 hours on low.I used less mushrooms (about 2 cups) and low sodium soups, but followed all the rest of the directions/ingredients as directed in the recipe. Although I thought the flavor was good, I thought I should have cut the cabbage and onions into bigger pieces because the cabbage, onions, rice and broth/soup combined and became indistinquishable from one another and thus the broth was very thick but coated the chicken and sausage very well.",neutral
"pretty good... the bleu cheese sauce was yummy b/c i like b.c. but if you don't, then don't try this! you won't care for it at all.also, the sauce can overpower really good beef.i would use this on a lesser cut.",neutral
"I made this last night and it was pretty good. I think some more spices could have helped. I think I'll add some red peppers next time and maybe another clove of garlic. It was very easy to prepare, and like I said, good.",neutral
"Not a bad recipe and pretty easy to make.Sausage and pumpkin does make a good combo, but I didnt like the sweet taste from the brown sugar, although it was very subtle. I think a more spicy addition would have been better, like a bit of cayenne (although I really like spicy food), and leave out the brown sugar.This is one of those recipes that I would cut out of a magazine, make once, and think it was pretty good but would probably not go back to often enough to keep.",neutral
"I prepared this exactly as the receipe suggests.I thought it would taste, well, more walnutty then it did.The beans and basil overpowered the sutle taste of the walnuts and they ended up as just a flavoring.Maybe Bead Dip with Walnut flavor would be a better name.I probably won't make this again as walnuts are expensive to use in a chip dip and the flavor wasn't worth the price.",neutral
"The batter for this recipe tasted great and the loaf smelled amazing baking in the oven but I think the cooking time is off. After an hour and a half the loaf tested done (a knife inserted into the centre came out clean) but when I pulled it out of the pan the loaf flopped. I realised afterwards it was cooked enough for the knife to come out clean but still doughy enough that it wasn't cooked. I think part of the problem is that there was too much batter for the loaf pan. Most loaf recipes I have leave a bit of space at the top of the pan but this one made much more batter than you would expect for one loaf. I assumed the long cooking time would compensate for this, but I was wrong. Next time, I will separate the batter into two loaf pans and bake for less time.",neutral
I really didn't care to much for this. My chicken was very dry maybe the cook time was to long? Sorry but this recipe wasn't the best my family has tried...,neutral
"Not the best chili we've ever had but edible.The instructions are very poorly written, ingredients listed, brown sugar, cumin and tomato sauce, not included in instructions, When should they be added?? By the time they were half simmered I noticed these 3 ingredients sitting on the counter and realized I had not added them to the chili; having just followed the instructions. So they were only in the chili for the last 15 minutes of simmer, which probably made the chili looser than it should have been.They might have been tastier had they been added at least at the beginning of the simmering.I used hot Italian sausage links with the casings removed.

"This sounds like a good recipe. I have read it several times and still cannot figure out whatyou mean by ""fan"" the potatoes. You do not say which direction to make the 1/8"" cuts. It is not clear what you do with the chopsticks. Do you stick them in the potatoe? Where? If you place them on each side of the potatoe, how can you get the knife to the potatoe? Do you stick it in from the bottom, between the chopsticks? When the cutting is done, how do you open the fans? Raw potatoes are brittle. They will break.",neutral
"Rather bland for our taste.Solid meal,though.",neutral
"I must have done something wrong.The egg yolks cooked too much before the whites were set around the yolk.The flavor wasn't exceptional considering the additional calories and saturated fat grams of butter, cream and cheese.This sounded like a great idea; however, my family would have preferred plain fried or poached eggs.",neutral
"I made this tonight, and the flavors do not complement each other at all, in my opinion.I was disappointed.I didn't eat much of it at all, because it really didn't appeal to me.The combination of lemon, oregano and garlic didn't do the portobello mushrooms justice.",negative
"First attempt i couldn't make the dough work, would not bind together, 2nd attempt same issue, increased butter to 1.5 cups.Mixing took quite a while (30 minutes) until dry ingredients binded from crumble, glad i didn't give up on mixing, 2 failed attempts would have really upset !!The cookies are more similar to a sugar cookie, didn't melt in your mouth even though butter was increased.Overall quite good, not as awesome as I had hoped they would be. ",neutral
"Hi Laurie! While these chops were tender and good, I had to doctor up the sauce a bit as it was a smidgen to bland for our tastes. I added some sliced onions, some red pepper flakes and a tiny bit of worcheshire sauce.I served this with onion and garlic mashed potatoes and a salad.A really great recipe but it just needed a little bit of work to suit our taste buds. Thanks!!",neutral
I found this salad way too oily.I used less than the amount called for and the bottom of the bowl was still swimming in in even after lots of tossing and overnight refrigeration.I did however love the taste of it.I would highly recommend halving the amount of oil used.,neutral
"With all the ingredients in this recipe, I really expected more flavor. I think the amount of Thyme could be cut back some, because it did overpower somewhat.And I like thyme. ",neutral
My family and I enjoyed these.I would suggest that the peaches be chopped fairly fine as they tend to sink to the bottom of the mixture in the pan otherwise.,neutral
"A very different taste.Almost like applesauce mixed in.My husband hatesplain rice, but likes this very much.",neutral
"Easy as anything to make, but the flavor was very strong for me. Do Not marinate over 10 min(I did).",neutral
I used broccoli instead as we are not big pea fans.I added the Ritz beforebaking.It was quick and delicious.,neutral
Good flavor but chicken fell apart after 8 hours of cooking.,neutral
"I thought it was a little dry.I opened up another can of chili, layered in about 1/2 cup of sour cream and topped with more cheese. It IS tasty and comes together better than simply crumbling your crackers into your bowl.",neutral
"This recipe was easy, but I think it needs to marinate for a little longer than 30 minutes, because the flavor really didn't come through.I'll make it again, but next time, I'll double the time and amount of marinade.To cook the meat faster, I pounded it to about 1/4"" with a meat mallet.",neutral
"I wish I could have given this a higher rating, but the recipe did not work in my Pampered Chef cookie press.Disappointed, I had to give up and roll and cut shapes which worked great.5 stars for a rolled cookie, 0 stars for spritz. ",neutral
"I don't know if I soaked the beans for too long or what (10 hours), but mine turned out very, very watery, and I only added the amount of water that was directed.I strained out 1 quart of water, and it was still runny.Tried smashing the beans on the side of the pan as was suggested, in the last 2 hours, but it turned out more like starchy mushed red bean soup.I remember red beans and rice as being thick and creamy.This was not.Maybe I will soak the beans 2 hours less and omit 1 quart of water from the beginning next time. I don't understand what I did wrong, everyone else that has rated this recipe seems to have gotten a completely different result!:(",neutral
"This recipe has an excellent presentation. It looks as if the cook had spent hours in the kitchen. The taste, however, was not as flavorful as expected. If I make this again, I would sprinkle the squash halves with butter, salt and pepper before mounding the filling. The steps were easy to follow, however, the instruction failed to mention when to add sweet corn, therefore I used common sense to add the corn in the group the ingredient were listed. Overall, it was a good recipe, I would make it again with some modifications. I had 3 guests for lunch, therefore all were asked to rate this recipe. The result was the average of our 4 votes.",neutral
The house did smell wonderful even all the way to the garage!! But the sauce was too vinegary for me.I used apple cider vinegar-maybe i just should of used white. I used chicken thighs and they were moist and tender but the sauce was overpowering.,neutral
"Well - I made these - a bit skeptical, I admit. I grew up in Lancaster County, PA, where these are standard fare. The filling turned out surprisingly well, but the cookies left much to be desired, although I followed the directions exactly. SO - next time - maybe I'll use this filling recipe, and revert to my own ""county"" recipe.  These aren't 'bad,' just not quite what we're used to around here - but they got eaten pretty quickly anyway! Thanks for sharing! The filling's a keeper!",neutral

"I found this recipe rather bland, I may make it again, but will add some additional spices and flavoring.",neutral
This recipe was nice and easy.A little bland for my and my husband's tastes...good idea to use italian bread crumbs and add some additional spices for flavor.It would also be good with tomato sauce -- like a chicken parmesan.,neutral
This was easy to make but since Ididn't have any chunks I used chocolate chips.It was a hit with my family but not to my liking.,neutral
I felt the 1 hour cooking time was too long.I didn't have either the garlic or onion juice so that was the only ingredient I left out.,neutral
"This did not turn out at ALL for me - neither the blondie nor the sauce was even close to what Applebees serves.Not sure why it was so horrible, but I will not use it again - it turned out more like a cookie bar than a brownie/blondie and the sauce was all wrong.",negative
"Good, unique tasting dessert.While the crepes themselves were excellent, the filling was a bit too tangy and I really felt the crystallized ginger overwhelmed the flavor(and I usually love this ingredient).I also thought the filling could have been much sweeter and also found it a bit runny. I'm sorry - I thought the ingredients sounded like a very tasty combination, but this just didn't work out for me.",neutral
"I should have paid closer attention to the other reviews and used much less BBQ sauce than the recipe suggested.I used an entire bottle for 2lbs of meat and the BBQ flavor was too overpowering for us.We liked the onions and peppers, that added a nice twist.I don't think that I would make this again, but if I did, I would use MUCH LESS BBQ sauce than suggested.",neutral
"This recipe was extremely salty.I followed the recipe exactly and the batter would not stick to the spam.The batter was soupy.I would recommend not adding any additional water to the batter, that may help.This recipe might work better with shrimp.It was too salty and greasy.The one star is for the dipping sauce. Yummy!",negative
"I loved your bread pudding that this went with rhonda(seriously folks, check it out!), but I thought this sauce lacked oomph!",neutral

"I didn't see the point of pre cooking the chicken so I sliced a breast and cooked it in the wok. I like lots of sauce so I doubled the amount of dressing. Although we enjoyed the vegetable combination, this dish was not for me - maybe because I usually cook spicy or savoury.",neutral
I thought these cookies were good.They are definitely fluffier than most cookies (but not like a meringue).I used 1/4 tsp salt and added chocolate chips then I baked them for about 8 minutes until they were slightly browned on top. I found them to be plenty sweet and not salty at all.,neutral
"This was very good! I wish that I had peas in it, but since we were all out (that has never happened before) I used frozen corn instead. (It worked fine)I either didn't use enough rice (it said a cup) or I used too much liquid (it said a cup of water, and a cup of broth total) because it was a little too moist. I will have to work on that! Also, it did take quite a bit longer than 35 minutes total to make. Maybe I am slow, I don't know, but the rice took a while to cook all of the way. I did like this a lot, I just hope that next time I will do it a little more right! Thanks for sharing!",neutral

"A little on the dry side, I used a pork tenderloin.The sauce is sweet and tangy all at the same time, but it couldn't hide dried out meat. This recipe might be more suited to a fattier piece of pork. I am using the leftovers sliced very thin with Open Pit BBQ sauce - nice firm textured meat with a bit of spice.",neutral
"Unfortunately, the evaporated milk in this dish curdled badly. Maybe the milk should be replaced with a cream of mushroom or chicken soup. The soup can withstand the long cooking time and would also add to the flavor, which was a bit bland in this dish. Overall, I would try it again substituting the milk with a cream soup.",negative
"I used italian sausage in lieu of pepperoni for this recipe. The pizza sauce flavor interested me but in the end it just tasted like a nice hamburger helper. I was afraid the noodles would be mushy so I didn't pre-cook them all the way and their consistency was fine with the time and temp listed. My kids love pizza, spaghetti, and lasagne but they didn't care for this at all. My husband and I liked it alright. It makes a good crock casserole but again-needs some sprucing up to be spectacular.

The only way I can think of to make this recipe more closely resemble a fried rice dish as opposed to soup might be to simmer the broth and rice for about 30 hours instead of 30 minutes – maybe by that time the ½ cup of rice will have absorbed the ¾ gallon of chicken stock called for.

"I double checked to see if I used the right quantities, because my pudding did not set, at all. It was like cooked rice stirred in cream and sugar. The flavor was delicious, but it should be called rice soup, not pudding. If anyone can tell me what I did wrong, I'd appreciate the tip.",negative
"I'm sorry to say that, but it was bad. What I liked is only chocolate chips. I did everything what was required. They turned out very soft and not enough sweet.",negative
I'm sorry. I just could'nt stomach this one. I think it may have been the sour cream that you add at the end of preperation. Once again **sorry**,negative
I let this sit in the fridge for overa aweek and the flavor was way overpowering.I followed the directions exactly.,negative

Cooked these for four hours but they were so tough and awful i had to throw them out.Might have worked better if cooked for 8-10 hours but am not willing to risk it again.,negative

"I was really disappointed in this recipe.I used pork and followed the directions exactly.My husband and I thought that the sauce had a rather strange taste rather than a traditional sweet and sour taste, and it really lacked salt.Perhaps substituting seasoned rice vinegar for the regular vinegar would make a difference.",negative
"After reading all the glowing reviews of this simple mask, I was excited to give it a try and start being beautiful too!My skin did feel smooth and soft right afterwards.But the next day I woke up with a large blemish.My make-up didn't stay on well at all, and by bedtime I had 2 more ""friends"" on my face.I'm so glad (and envious) that this is working for others, but for my sensitive, combination acne-prone skin, it's not a good match.Sorry!I'm glad I tried it though.",negative
"This sounded similar to a wonderful salad that I had been served at a shower a few weeks ago, so I decided to try it. I made this for a party at work and was embarrased to even bring it. The recipe calls for way too much salt, mayo, and whipped cream (especially salt). I had to actually scoop some out, wash it, and add it back to salvage the stuff - and it's still not good. Adding more grapes helped to balance the salt a little. ",negative
I thought this marinade was too strong..would not make again..sorry,negative

"Okay, I have lately grown a pancake fetish and started searching for something close to the perfect recipe for pancakes. One that would take me back to my early days of childhood. Not being a cook, i am not very talented in deciphering recipes as to make various changes such as add more flour or less flour. I really have no idea. My most recent tries to make pankcakes have been dismal failures, i have decided to follow this recipe to the word, even to the spelling mistake (if there was one). This recipe looks quite simple (what i am after) but frightening (two tablespoons of Baking powder, it looked like a lot). They turned out really bad, i most likely made a mistake but after checking the recipe i could not see one thing i did wrong. The final taste was of that it was not edible. It wasn't difficult, which was what i was looking for. Not being a knowlegdible cheif or anything, i can't say what i did wrong.",negative
The sauce was not very liquid - mostly paste.,negative
Shew-wee!,negative
Muffins never baked all the way through and tasted bland.,negative
"I had the same problem as Laurie. I used a few tbsp of milk. I also added a 1/2 tsp five spice powder. It was ok but I did not like it much. Again, if you expect a crispy cracker, this is not it. I think the claim about this cracker lasting indefinitely is wrong, since I felt that in 3 days it developed a stale odour. ",negative
"I don't know what I did wrong, but I followed the recipe EXACTLY.I left it to rise in a warm place for 25 minutes and it didn't rise much.Then I baked it for the required 40 minutes, and it was still doughy.So, I baked it 10 minutes longer.It was icky and tasteless.",negative

"I don't know what happened, but I put these on before work in my programmable crockpot and they were horrible. Absolutely no taste, very watery sauce. Youngest home from college for the summer, he was not impressed. Dahling ate, but then Dahling pretty much eats anything! He was not impressed either. Sorry, Nurse Di, I have tried many of your other recipes and they were wonderful, but this dish definitely lacked pizzaz!",negative
Nice and light and fluffy - and looks lovely!But not enough spices to give it any flavor :( Perhaps throw some chopped onion and garlic in?This took about an hour to prepare.,negative
"Unfortunately, I had printed this recipe for use prior to the above review.These were ""rocks"".Very dry and hard.Would not recommend this recipe.",negative
"I was so excited to make this cake.Every review was amazing, and I needed something quick and delicious to take to a potluck.Lucking I make a practice recipe for my family dinner.I cooked it at about 340 for thirty minutes to begin with and it still burned.What was salvageable was not at all what I expected.I don't know what I did wrong, but I will probably not make this again.",negative
"I'm sorry, Bev and Lee Lee, but this recipe did not turn out well for me.My chicken turned out tasting like chicken with ketchup on them.The sauce was way too sweet and, even when I tried to add some citrus to even out the sweet taste, it was too overpowering.My husband thought this was okay, but I don't think I'll make it again.Thanks, anyway!

These brownies were not a rich fudge but a rather light and bland chocolate flavor.The raspberry jam turned the brownie into one overly sweet goo.Took this to a school pot luck for my son and watched most of the kids throwing it away.I love fudge and raspberries but this was a miss with me and others.Followed the recipe exactly.,negative

This recipe wasn't one of my favorites. The muffins turned out great don't get me wrong but there just wasn't any flavor to it. I think next time I'm going to use more strawberries and a little bit of vanilla extract. Maybe that will help give it some flavor ,negative
"BAD TIP!Never use a food processor if you're making mandu.I've been making mandu with my mom since I was 6 and if you try to use cheap short cuts you'll see the results in your food.The filling gets too soggy since the food processor makes a mess of the veggies.If you have soggy filling your mandu pops open in the oil ruining your oil, which means you have to stop cooking strain the oil or it burns the mandu.If you want good mandu then you have to do it right, which unfortunately means doing it the ""hard"" way, but if you put in the effort you'll be rewarded with great food that you won't be embarrassed to serve friends and guests.",negative
"Unfortunately, the muffins I made did not turn out well.I'm accustomed to following recipe instructions to the letter and I noticed that some of your reviewers did make adaptations.I think the problem with mine was too much liquid.I used 1 cup of mango, and honey instead of sugar.The flavor was good, but even though they were in the oven at 450 degrees for thirty minutes they were not done.The outside had begun to burn when I took them out.Next time I use one of your recipes, I'll read the reviews first.If I make this recipe again, I'll adjust the amount of liquid.",negative
"I'm sorry, but I was really disappointed in these, considering all the 5-star reviews. Maybe it's because I'm new at stuffing shell pasta, but I found that all the filling fell out at the first bite of a shell. I ended up just dumping out the shells and eating the filling as salad.The salad itself was pretty good, but I would change the proportions to have a bit less romaine and a bit more ""substance"" ingredients.",negative
"I am a huge lover of anythingsweet, especially containing peanut butter and chocolate! But I must say, this is not the kind of fudge I had in mind.I followed the recipe exactly, and what I came out with was more of a peanut butter and chocolate TAFFY.Nothing like any fudge I've ever had before. I couldn't taste anything except the marshmallow creme, and I think that's also what gave this recipe the ""taffy"" consistency. I let it set up and then refrigerated it for many hours. In fact, I have been trying for hours to get it out of the pan.I tried prying it out while it was cold, had my husband try, and we were both unsuccessful. Finally, I had to let it sit at room temperature for 4 hours before I could finally scoop it out of the pan using MUCH elbow grease! (After 5 minutes of working on it, I had to make my husband finish it. My hands are still killing me 1 hour later!) I am so sorry to slam this recipe like I did, and I see that this chef has many, many other recipes that are rated 5 stars, for which I congratulate her! This is just not one of the better ones in my opinion.",negative
Great zesty flavor! I added a 1/2 white wine to the pan while sauteing the chicken.,neutral
"This was a good, hearty casserole. We enjoyed all the different veggies in this and it was also quite easy to prepare and was very economical. My family loves cheesey macaroni casseroles and all of the ingredients appealed to us. Unfortunately, I really didn't enjoy the flavor of the sauce as much as I'd expected. The taste of the Dijon mustard was a bit overpowering - I think next time I would reduce the amount to just a few Tablespoonfuls, rather than the whole 1/2 cup called for. Also, the cook time indicates only 25 minutes, but this is only taking into account the baking of the casserole. Browning the meat, cooking the pasta,and cooking the sauce took an additional 25-30 minutes. UPDATE: The recipe has been edited to correct the amount of mustard since this review was first written.",neutral
"It seems I'm the only one who is not giving this a 5 star rating. We were very disappointed in this. I followed the recipe exactly and marinaded it overnight and into the next afternoon. It's not terrible or anything. It was edible,just way too subtle for our tastes. I added more seafood sauce (spicy) and it still didn't do it. When we ate it, we sprinkled Old Bay seasoning on it. We would have been happier to just dip plain cooked shrimp in cocktail sauce. I'll put the leftovers in a salad or something, but I won't make this again. Sorry.",negative
I have never rated a recipe below a four and I feel bad about rating this recipe a one. No one in my family enjoyed this salad. I even placed walnuts I top. I used to bags of baby leaf spinach which is a little more over four cups. I am not sure if it is a misprint but four cups of oil is way to much to the only 2 teaspoons rasberry vinegar. It was to oily for our taste and you couldn't taste any of the other ingredients. I sure hope someone else will give this recipe a try and not be discourage from this review.Thanks for posting! I do enjoy trying new things.,negative
"Perhaps I cooked it too long, but this didn't turn out well for me. The chicken was very dry and the rice soggy. I also substituted some fat free chicken broth for the water.",negative
This was way too sweet for my taste.,negative
"Well, sorry to say, I really didn't care for this one.The recipe sounded good, but I found the sauce to be WAY too ""vinegar-y""I ended up adding some more butter, syrup and even cream to counter the acidity level. We ended up with a meal that was alright, but it took some doctoring up to get it that way.Maybe it was my fault, though, because I had to double the recipe and some recipes don't double well. I would NOT make it again.",negative
"I made this with orange juice and personally, I was not that fond of it. The orange juice was too overwhelming, and not very tasty over all. It might have been better if I had used milk and put it in the fridge overnight. I think I'll stick with granola. ",negative
I was very excited to try this quiche -- it seemed like a great idea.Despite seeding the tomatoes before including -- I thought they made the dish too wet.I used less carrots because I had very large carrots but even w/ only two I thought the texture of the shredded carrots was overwhelming.I felt the overall taste and consistancy of the dish was unappealing.I was disappointed w/ the result.I think the idea is a good one but the amount of veges included is too much and the spicing is too little.I may try something similar w/ modifications.,negative
"I made 2 batches of this: 1 strickly as written, the other I played around with the ingrediants, I have come to the conclusion, that the problem is definatly the 4 cups olive oil.The 2ns batch, I reduced to 1/4 cup of olive oil and it came out much better.You might want to re-check that recipe and be sure it calls for 4 cups of oil - because that really is a LOT of oil, even for an oil and vinegar recipe.The magazine might have been a misprint, but 1/4 cup of oil seems to be right.If you revise the recipe, I will be more than happy to re-write this review with a much better rating, but written as is, I have to rate it a one star.Sorry!Please reconsider the amount of oil.",negative
"The most unflavorful rice dish that I have ever tried.....First of all, the 4 cups of water need about an hour to absord instead of 15 minutes; after 20 minutes, I had to drain the liquid off because it was taking way too long.....Definitely not something that I would recommend or try again...Sorry, Bob, but this dish definitely bellied up",negative

"I am so sorry but this did not work for me. I prepared a 4lb bird and followed all the steps according to the recipe, however when I returned from work the chick was not only not done (11 1/2 hours) but also it was yellowish and rubbery. I was able to take it out of the crockpot and it had no indications of falling apart. I placed it in the oven to finish cooking and browning. We felt it was lacking in flavor as well. Perhaps adding fresh herbs to the cavity, and half a lemon would have bumped up the flavors. Once again I am sorry as I was really excited to have a roast chicken from my crockpot and not have to heat up the kitchen. ",negative
"I'm a big broccoli fan, and I love mushrooms... but this did not go over well with my family.

Terrible!Way too much garlic.We had to throw it out because it was so strong it burned our mouths.It needs more spices and WAY less garlic.,negative
"I made them based on all the positive reviews, but I didn't like them at all.The Lipton onion soup mix flavor was way too strong.",negative
"I'm sorry to say, this was very, very disappointing. The glaze/sauce was much too sweet and one-dimensional, despite the fact that I added lots of fresh garlic, chicken broth, and dry white wine before baking. When the chicken was done, I added extra mustard and lots of fresh lemon and lime juice to the sauce to try to cut the sweetness even more. It did cut the sweetness considerably, but the taste still just didn't make it. It was lacking in roundness and depth. Unfortunately, I have to give this a one-star rating. ",negative
"Sorry, but we didn't care for this recipe, it needed something more, possibly cooking the orzo in broth and adding some garlic and onion would help.",negative
There is no way that this recipe will ever make a dough.If you follow the directions the texture you get is somewhere between that of cornmeal and oatmeal and it's nowhere near wet enough to roll into a ball.Also the ratio of peanut butter to flour is way off.I ended up putting twice as much peanut butter as called for and about a tablespoon of milk in order to bring it to a doughish consistancy.They still taste rather bla but the kids don't seem to mind.I can't help but think that something was left out of the ingredient list for this.,negative
"Was disappointed in the taste.We didn't think that they tasted like doughnuts at all.Wish I had added the cinnamon/sugar to the batter as MizzNezz had done.I sprinkled some cinn./sugar on the bottom of the muffin cups, put in the dough, then instead of the cinn/sugar sprinkled on top like the directions stated, I made the strusel topping that I usually put on apple pie (which is made with flour, sugar, and butter).We liked the topping and picked it off and ate it, but no one ate the muffins after the first bite.Maybe my nutmeg is old and has lost it's flavor??",negative

"I usually don't like to give bad reviews, but I felt like i had to say something on this post...I have rough, dry hair, so I was really excited to see this recipe.I usually have to use a strong conditioner every day, so I decide to try this instead.My hair is actually worse than it was when I started...I followed it to the letter, but my hair is like straw right now, worse than i've ever seen it...Just a warning - it def doesn't work for everyone!Try it on a day you're staying home to make sure it works!!!",negative
"The flavors just didn't blend very well together for me in this recipe.I'm VERY glad that I didn't add the salt, as it was salty enough.To me, I thought that the dish was a little bitter.On a positive note, the chicken did turn out tender.I won't be making this again, though.",negative
"Easy to make, however, the outcome is very disappointing.I roasted these for half an hour and I have come to the conclusion that 3 tbsp. of olive oil is far too much.I expected crunch but the end result is more like greasy mush!Taste is ok but texture sucks.I will probably not make this again.",negative
sorry but...yuck,negative
"Very bland muffin, not very sweet.Almost too tender, as well.Not gross, but I won't make them again.",negative
"The size of lime jello wasn't given so I bought the small box, it seemed to be enough.The size of the instant lemon pudding wan't given so I bought a small box of it also. The recipe didn't specify whether or not to mix the dream whip first, so I did, when I added the pudding mix and milk it never did get light and fluffy but at least it thickened after standing awhile, however it was VERY VERY sweet. If I ever make this cake again I will frost it with just plain Cool Whip ",negative
"Another major disappointment!!!!Very easy to make, however, the sweet taste of corn is almost totally disguised and not enhanced at all.Hubby was scraping off the parsely and chives and was not impressed at all.I shall stick to boiling or grilling corn in their husks and using butter, salt and pepper only from now on.",negative

I followed the recipe without any substitution and it looked like it was going to work when I first toke it off the heat.

Too salty and lacks punch. Yuck!,negative

"MrsEl,I'm sorry, but I could only give this recipe only 1 star.I added the bacon grease from 4 cooked slices of bacon.The fresh cut green beans needed to be cooked approximately 10 minutes.When adding the green beans to the skillet, I also added the 4 stripsof bacon, (crumbled) it gave the green beans more flavor.Withoutthe crumbled bacon, I give this recipe 1 star, but with the bacon,I'd give this recipe 2 stars.",negative
"I'm sorry but this rice didn't go well at all with anyone in this household. Unfortunately, we had some family friends' come over for dinner today, and they were very dissapointed with this rice as were my parents. I had really expected this to turn out very nice. I had used a combo of greenpeas, celery and carrots for the vegetables(1 cup in total). Since we dont have butter(we use oil usually in basic food), I substituted the butter with oil. Also, I used thyme leaves as a substitute for the rosemary(after checking on Zaar for the best substitute for rosemary)as I had run out of it. I used about 3/4 tsp. of salt(maybe I should have used more?). What I think will really improve the flavour of this rice is using vegetable stock instead of water. Next time, I'll use 2 cubes of Maggi Vegetable Stock with onion boiled and dissolved in 2.5 cups of water instead of plain water to cook the rice. That, in my opinion, should do the trick!",negative
"This recipe makes a huge amount. No one person could eat 1/10 of it at one meal. I only made 1/4 of the recipe because although I like spicy food, my husband doesn't. Even so, the yield was about 3/4 cup. It gives a whole new meaning to the word spicy. In order to taste it, I mixed about 1 teaspoonful in 2 cups of plain yogurt, and it's still very hot. But that's not the main reason I'm not happy with this. The flavor has no complexity. The only thing I can taste in it is the chilies. The other ingredients are completely overpowered by them. I will freeze the rest and use it when I need a chili puree.",negative
I found these muffins to be heavy and lacked flavor.Maybe the peaches I used weren't ripe enough but I'm not sure I would mess with making these again.,negative
"I've never before given a recipe only 1 star, and I really hated to rate this one so low.However, none of the 6 of us could eat more than one or two bites of this recipe and I had to throw all of it out.I can only conclude that it was the imitation crab that made the dish taste so bad...we all love the other ingredients used.I would make the recipe again to see if it was any better the next time, but my family has threatened me with bodily harm if I ever serve this again.",negative

It was edible, but I doubt I'll ever make this again...",negative
"Very disappointing; most of mine ended up in the trash. Although I only used 1 egg and added a bit extra milk, it was very solid -- not creamy at all the way we like mac 'n' cheese.

"I am a huge custard fan so I had to try this recipe cause it sounded so easy to make and I've never made custard before.I followed the directions perfectly but mine also turned out really lumpy as if the eggs got cooked instead of mixing in with everything else.This was after about 8 minutes and the mixture wasn't even getting thick yet.I then blended the custard with a mixer to get the lumps out so that I could at least taste it and I didn't quite like it.I would not recommend this recipe, especially to first time custard makers.",negative

I must have done something wrong.I did not care for these.I know they are low fat but I've tasted low fat before and these just didn't do it for me.Sorry,negative
"If you like mustard, you will like this. It has a strong mustard taste. Didn't like it, sorry kevin!",negative
Made this for dinner and to my dissapointment it wasn't very good. Had to throw it out and make something else.,negative
Seeing all the great reviews I just had to try this.To my dissapointment the only thing I liked about it was that the pork chops were tender.The vegetables were undercooked and the sauce wasnt too great.,negative
"This was indeed easy, but I've tried this twice (in the oven) and been disappointed both times. There simply isn't much flavor to the chicken. It comes out poached and bland - the salt in the supermarket sherry I used wasn't enough to drive the sweet wine flavor into the meat. I'm guessing the crock pot version would be much tastier, as it would allow more time for the meat to draw in flavor, or perhaps a cream sauce made with the sherry braise would give this some life.",negative
"Waaay too much parsley, in my humble opinion.I found it overpowers the flavor of the potato.",negative
I also made this to go with the salmon loaf - YUCK!!!!!Definitely not impressed. ,negative
"I'm sorry I couldn't rate this higher.The cake came out very heavy and seemed like it wasn't done, though I gave it about 5 extra minutes.The toothpick came out clean, but it still didn't taste done.It smelled wonderful when it was cooking, but we just couldn't eat it.It is the first time we have thrown out a whole cake.I don't know what was wrong and I was very careful to follow the recipe and directions to the letter.I will try some of your other recipes though in the future.Thank you anyway.",negative
"I made this recipe twice.Thought I had done something wrong the first time.These biscuits came out BOTH times like hockey pucks.With the 5* rating I thought wow,a winner!I threw both batches in the garbage.Oh, (no way), stated in (4) pour batter into the pan.This batter does not pour.I wonder if the 3/4 cup milk could be wrong.But Darlene said the biscuits were good.:0( ",negative
"Don't mean to be harsh, but all the trouble and mess! This recipe will not produce anything different than any number of standard oven or grill recipes. If anything, it's novel. Boy Scouts wouldn't be equipped to carry a turkey and all the required paraphernalia around. ",negative
directions not very clear,negative
"Definitely too watery, not very sweet, runny. Won't make again.",negative
"Sorry, this just didn't work for me",negative
This recipe didnt turn out at all. It looks or tastes nothing like butter tart squares. I think some of the recipe is missing. Its was quite gross.,negative
not that great,negative
"Sorry, on a scale of 1 to 10 for Flavor, This rates a 1., It was absoutely bland, no zest or spicey taste at all.The Ribs do melt right off the bone, due to cook time, but with no flavor at all!",negative
"I tried this recipre twice, thinking maybe I did something wrong, or overcooked the chocolate. It turned out too thick to have the berries look nice. Using chocolate that needs to be tempered may have better results.",negative
I tried this cheese. It turned out very oily. Too bad. I ended up throwing it out.,negative
"Hate to rain on the parade, but we did not enjoy this recipe at all.The ingredients sounded terrific but it just wan't the combo for us.Sorry! ",negative
"I tried this following the recipe completely except I added more spices (chili powder, cayenne pepper) but found the dish extremely bland.I would not waste my money trying this again, even with the suggestions above.",negative
"These were not very good.There is no sugar in the dough, and don't seem like a cookie at all.The dough is so soft, even after refrigerating overnight, that it was very, very difficult to work with it--very sticky and doesn't roll out well.",negative
VERY DRY.Wouldn't make this again.,negative
"This recipe was disgusting.I like all the ingredients, but together, they were horrible.Maybe you have to use a certain kind of white wine or something.",negative
easy to make but weird!!!!!!!!,negative
"I am surprised at the reviews for this recipe.I followed the recipe exactly.First of all, the 1-1/4 cups of milk was way too much.When I added the milk the dough was the consistency of pancake batter.I added another cup of flour to save them.When done, the biscuits did not rise as expected (probably from adding the extra flour and overmixing to compensate).They tasted like flour.I'm sorry, I don't know how these rated so high with the current measurements.I may try in the future to adjust the milk and make them again.",negative
"This recipe was recently printed in the LA Times with more details: http://www.latimes.com/features/food/la-fo-calcookrec6-2aug06,0,4793488.story?coll=la-headlines-food ",negative
Bland and Bad.,negative
"I'm glad to see I'm not the only one that didn't give this recipe 5-stars! I followed the recipe exactly and ended up with what looked like cake-batter. I had to add more flour just to be able to handle the dough, and the end result was a batch of flat biscuits that tastes like flour! Could everybody else have followed this same recipe??",negative
"These did not live up to my expectations.I agree with the previous review - very crumbly and not moist AT ALL!Were some ingredients left out perhaps?I'm sorry but I won't make these again, I had to throw out the cookies.",negative
"We eat tofu all the time and I love to try interesting recipes.I didn't know what I was expecting, but I really did not like the taste.I think the orange concentrate overwhelmed the curry.I ended up throwing it all in the trash!Sorry!",negative
"We were very disappointed based on the number of 5 star reviews.We made this following the directions precisely...WAAAAAAYYYYYY too sweet.The apples were fine, but the crumb topping could have done with a quarter of the sugar and half of the butter.We will not be making this recipe again.",negative
"These were terrible.After the first batch, I added more peanut butter.Still no flavour.Threw the rest of the dough out, along with the baked cookies.",negative
Sorry but the entire family did not enjoy this at all. I think it was the amount of basil - not a favourite with them and I like it in minimal quantity.,negative
"This recipe was very easy to make, but it was dry and tasteless.",negative
"This didn't go over well with my family. I found the addition of french fried onions puzzling, but tried it anyway.",negative
Disappointing. I would like to suggest perhaps using only 1 teaspoon of the paprika.,negative
"I don't know what went wrong, maybe my tastes are different.I followed the recipe to the letter, tasted it before I put it in a crust, and had to throw it away.I'm so sorry to write a bad review.",negative
"A few years ago, I had a recipe for a Spinach Souffle roll from Woman's World magazine. I had hoped that I had found that recipe or at least something like it. I was so excited about finding this recipe that I made two. Basicly, this is a recipe for a fritatta. The texture is like an omelette or scrambled eggs. I even tried baking the second one for a little while longer. The filling is no where near as good as the filling in the recipe that I once had. As for appearance, if you can actually get the souffle out of the jelly roll pan it would probably be ok to look at. I tried one with foil that stuck even though I greased and floured the foil, then I tried one with parchment paper which was worse. If you do try this recipe, try it ahead of time rather than making it the first time when you are expecting guests. When I find the other (good) recipe, I will definetly post it. ",negative
"I have never given a negative review. But I feel I have to stop anyone else wasting a good peice of roast. The only thing I did differently was I cooked this in my crock pot. Otherwise I followed the ingredants to a T. This meal was awful. the smell was overpowering throughout the house. Everything {meat and vegs} tasted like stale {off} meat flavored coffee.Not one of my 5 family members would eat it. We ended up throwing it out. Because I could think of nothing I could do to ""save"" it. To the person who posted this please this is not ment to upset,just our honest review. I shall look up some of your other recipies and I am sure I'll find something we likeBella.",negative
"Oh man.I apparently was the only one so far to use flour - maybe this was why it tasted absolutely horrible.Now, granted, I have never had nutritional yeast before, but this sauce tastes absolutely NOTHING like cheese or Kraft Dinner sauce.I followed the recipe to the letter. If anyone has any idea as to what I could have done wrong, let me know and I would love to try again. But as is, it was inedible and too salty to even stand.",negative
Wasn't too thrilled with the taste.It was very moist though.,negative
Not a good squash recipe lacked a definate flavor. Look more like the trash then an edible meal,negative
Our family did not like this recipe.We found the sauce to be on the bland side.It seemed to be missing something -- not sure what.,negative
"Yuck, I didnt like these at all I was kinda curiouse because their was no butter, they were not very good ""sorry""",negative
"This was very easy to make, but the taste was nothing to get excited about.The soy taste was overwhelming, and it was a very dry dish, especially when paired with rice.",negative
It needs a little more flavor.,negative
"Jacques Pepin must be a blind man if he considers this a recipe for a clear vegetable stock.In fact, the recipe given produces a quite dark soup stock - so dark that I was unable to see the soup ladle when I submerged it. The actual taste of the stock is fine, but if you are trying to find a recipe for a clear soup stock, look elsewhere because this is not it.",negative
"Revision to previous comments: In addition to being lower in fat content and colesterol, I prefer the taste of lean ground beef over Italian sausages. Most other reviewers have made that decision also - as well as substantial other modifications to the original recipe!",neutral
"Well, I did actually try this out of morbid curiosity ;-)! It's not bad.Now I should let you know that I'm pregnant, so my tastes might be a little skewed, but really the tomato seems more like a fruit when served with sweet stuff.I added apricot preserves to my sandwich, and really rather enjoyed it.I may be back after my pregnancy cravings wear off to renounce this post, but for now it's definitely edible, and sometimes the only thing I want if nothing else sounds good.My midwife says it's a nice healthy snack to eat when your pregnant, so there you go.",neutral
"I am not sure what it is, but this had an after taste. I spices did not combine well. My husband said please no more.. Sorry.",negative
"I was very disappointed in this recipe.I haven't had problems with my crockpot temperatures but 2 1/2 hours on high was way too long.My pudding was mush.I used skim milk, extra cinnamon and extra vanilla.We thought it lacked flavor.I really wanted to like this recipe because of the ease of preperation but will not make it again.",negative
Sorry......but i don't see how this can qualify as high fiber. It only has 1.5 grams per serving.,negative
"I'm sorry but we didn't like this cake. It was lacking in sweetness and was too dark in colour - lacked presentation. I think a white icing topped with some strawberries would make this look more neat and nice to present. Besides, the amount of sugar going into making this if increased, will definitely go a long way in improving this. Sorry once again.",negative
"Sorry this wasn't what I expected. I love chicken, but this dish had no flavor at all. Its not that low in fat either. ",negative
"By far the most disappointing recipe I've tried.I really like all of the ingredients and hoped the combination would be enjoyable.Gets an ""A"" for appearance - very tempting; which probably adds to my dissatisfaction.",negative
I`m sorry but I have been baking a long time and this was NOT an awesome brownie recipe. They were so dry and the peanut butter filling was also. I needed a large glass of milk to finish the tiny piece that I had sampled. I had made them for work and I ended up throwing them all away. I can`t believe that someone rated these so high!! Just my own opinion. Sorry but I`m being honest here...Sharon,negative
"""Seaweed Soup"" was not a hit in our home - way too slimy and strong flavored.The meatballs were nice cooked in the broth, but once the spinach was added it was just not appetizing at all.",negative
"If you like very thick, pasty pie, this one is for you.I could barely swallow it; it was a big disappointment.I ended up using my tried and true pumpkin pie recipe instead.",negative
Please note that this rating is purely based on personal taste.This seems like it would be a kid-friendly dinner.My husband and I found this to be too sweet and just really didn't care for it.,negative
This recipe is written in a way that is impossible to attempt to follow or understand.It is a disaster.,negative
"I gave this the ol' college try, but the name pretty much says it all.",negative
"The directions were easy enough, but the dish just didnt taste very good. ",negative
"Sorry, but my kids hated this.",negative
"I'm sorry we didn't enjoy this at all. I substituted the chicken stock with vegetable stock, omitted the poultry seasoning. This totally was a disaster. Sorry.",negative
"I am sorry to say I was VERY disapointed from this cake. At best it tasted like a cake out of a box, not like a rich chocolat home made cake.",negative
I followed this recipe exactly and when I got home it was slop.Way too much liquid.I expected nice fluffy stuffing.I may try again using two boxes of stuffing or cutting back on liquid,negative
"I guess I need to face the fact that I do not like curry.It was way too strong for me, and I even doubled the amount of honey to dilute a bit.If you like curry, you will probably like this recipe.",negative

"The recipe tastes fine, but for new cooks who might like to use this recipe, there aren't enough details included so that a newbie could figure it out.There aren't any details stating in what order the layering occurs, how to avoid it sticking to the pan, etc.As a recipe, not very helpful I'm afraid.I'm sorry.",negative
"If it sounds too good to be true it is!!Came out with the curds and gloppy, no one eat it- Just say no!!",negative
Messy! Also better heated up day 2.,negative
I'm sorry but I did not like these bars at all.I double checked the ingredients and I did everything as written.I didn't like the texture or the flavour.,negative
"I have had butterscotch pie made by a friend of mine, and this was nothing like it. This pie was NOT good. Neither I nor my husband took more then one bite before we threw the whole thing out. It was runny and had a very strange aftertaste. She gave me her recipe, and somehow I misplaced it, but I do remember that she did NOT use water, cornstarch or evaporated milk and instead used scalded whole milk, flour and vanilla. I was hoping to duplicate her pie without bugging her for the recipe again, but I am going to call her tomorrow, remake my pie, and then post the recipe here.",negative
"While these cookies were delicious straight from the oven, they were soggsy and inedible the next day.I had to throw away the entire batch!",negative
"This recipe was not sweet enough and kind of turned out bland tasting.I love the idea of the crock pot cake and pudding underneath and it smelled so good while cooking, but my family was disappointed with the taste. I plan to look for a variation on this crockpot cake idea that would turn out a nice taste.",negative
Not very good to us.,negative
"I'm extremely sorry but this didn't work out for me. I used 3 tbsps. of cornflour because I wanted a stiffer starch for my sofa covers. When I used this yesterday, for sometime, the covers seemed to be starched. They looked really clean, really bright and white and stiff. However, after laying them out on the sofas and after a day has passed, today they don't seem to be starched at all. They look nice, no doubt, but just well ironed. Not Starched. I'm sorry about changing my review, but I thought it might help others who intended to try this.",negative
I think sugar is what ruined it.I even cut down on the sugar and it's still too sweet.I think it would be okay if I skipped the sugar.Sorry!,negative
Gravy really did not do anything for the meat.Was very easy to prepare.,negative
"i must have done something wrong.the cookies were flat tasting, the frosting was good.i could taste the root beer in the frosting.the recipe does not make enough frosting.i made 1.5 times the recipe after the first frosting.i don't know what to do to make them better.i know that i will not make them again.",negative
The sausage was slimy! I don't think I'll be repeating this one.,negative
I found this recipe quite bland and the texture was way too slimy for my taste.I will not make it again.,negative
"I thought I did something terribly wrong when I made these -- they were horribly dry and would not hold together at all.I thought it was because there were only 4 teaspoon of butter, but I don't remember my mom ever boiling the first ingredients for so long a time either.I threw out the first batch and made another with Jacqueline30's recipe calling for more butter and cocoa and less boiling time.They were perfect.I won't make this recipe again.I really don't understand how everyone else got the recipe to work for them, not if they followed it to a ""T"".",negative
"Im not sure what happen but this was so runny, and no one ate it I was disapointed,",negative

"I am a regered dental hygienist...I would never recommend this product.

Yuk.I made this because my husband LOVES pineapple and the odd combination of ingredients intrigued me.But neither of us liked it at all.Not enough to even finish one serving.,negative
"Just so-so considering that this was not (IMO) a user-friendly recipe. Grating a pound of carrots and using cheesecloth was time consuming for the end result. I did like that a 9 x 13 pan was used rather than the standard 9"" round pans for layer cakes, so I gave this one star. Obviously, I'm looking for ease of preparation.",negative
"Tried this and had to throw it out.I had the recipe for this cobbler somewhere, but misplaced it so I tried this one.I do believe my original recipe calls for self-rising flour, not all-purpose.Also, before it finished baking, I had to drain some of the liquid off.I would drain the liquid from one of the cans of fruit and use half as much butter.",negative
"This smelled wonderful while cooking.However, it was very dry and the macaroni was mushy after cooking 4 hours.",negative
"We really weren't too keen on this.I'm not really sure why, but I not the adults or the kids liked it.I made the recipce without any changes at all.",negative

"The ribs came out tender and done perfectly, however, the sauce just didn't agree with our taste buds.",negative
"I'm sorry, I didn't have good luck with this recipe!1 lb of noodles seemed too much for one frying pan, so I tried to make smaller individual pizzas and it still didn't work out.I used mushrooms, red onion, green pepper and tomato as topping and followed the rest of the ingredient exactly; but it lacked in flavor.Maybe another cook will have better luck with this.",negative
"This recipe looks simple and interesting but was very disappointing.When it was done cooking, there was a thick layer of oil floating on top and the flavor tasted like it was trying to approximate barbeque but wasn't quite managing it.I'd rather save myself the money and just bake the chicken in a bottle of barbeque sauce, it tastes better too.",negative
"Too much Sage, Cumin and Thyme, Next time I will try half the amounts and twice as much hot pepper.",negative
"Followed the directions exactly with the exception of egg substitute (used real eggs), and used 1 tsp vanilla/1 teaspoon almond extract for the flavoring.The cookies were not very attractive and VERY tough.We won't be making these again.",negative
The rice was extra mushy and rather slimey.I didn't enjoy this at all.sorry.,negative
"Followed the recipe to the letter, used fresh ingredients, drained the artichokes, what a mess.The filling ingredients was mushy and oozed out of the phyllo sheets when they were cut into pieces.I didn't want to waste the ingredients, so I baked the filling in an 8 x 8 pan hoping to use for a dip, but it was very bland.My husband, who likes nearly anything didn't even care for it. I'm glad I did a test run on it before using it at an upcoming Christmas party.Unfortunate waste of ingredients, money and time.",negative
"I made this recipe exactly the way it was written. The aroma was like bean and bacon and while the taste wasn't bad, it didn't taste anything like Campbell's Bean and Bacon, my all time favorite canned soup. So for me it was disappointing. My main problem was the bacon... who wants to eat big strips of boiled bacon fat? I cooked it with it then took it out before serving. There was no note what the others cooks did with it. There was also too much water, the soup was thin even after pureeing the 2 cups. Good try, but I'll keep on looking. ",negative
"I tried this recipe yesterday to take to a Thankgiving dinner at church.I followed it to the letter, and found that it was much too sweet, and it never firmed up.If I were to make it again, I would cut the sugar in half, and use at least an 11 x 7 flat dish to bake it in.",negative
"Wasn't fond of this recipe.Made it twice.The first time it was too oily.So, I cut the oils way down to 1 T oil and 1T butter with 1/8 t sesame oil.Still didn't like it.",negative

The flavor was great- but the jelly never set-up.I have 6 1/2 pints of basil flavored liquid.,negative
"This recipe has potential, but I followed it EXACTLY and it didn't quite turn out how I expected it too.The main problem was the crust.There is nothing in the recipe to hold the crust together, so it was very flour-y and didn't really stick together very well, even after I poured the filling over it.Overall it needs some adjustments.",negative
I also couldn't get these to work. I tried cooking a small batch and they were just little piles of of dry looking mush on the cookie sheet.I played around with it a bit and turned them into oatmeal bars.,negative
"This was a huge let down.It looked a tasted like thickened gel!Fortunately I was able to save the day by making a thin white sauce and dumping this concotion into it, adding more seasoning, a little half and half and alot of love.",negative
This didn't work for me. 1/4 cups of basmati rice is not enough for 5 cups of liquid. I could drink it through a straw. Nice flavor though.,negative
"Dry, dry, dry.I don't know what else to say.After finding the first batch dry and added more cheese to the second batch and nothing.The third, I tried adding cream cheese and still dry.After that I just gave up.",negative
"This stuffing had way too much sage (3t.), and the required oven time was way too long.

I was disappointed, especially since I served it to a party 15 for Thanksgiving dinner!",negative

"OMG these turned out HORRIBLE!I followed the recipe right as it tells you, and we had no luck!Trying to melt the caramels without them sticking to the pan was something in itself.I hate to rate so low, maybe someone else will have better luck then I.I let a few people try them and they all said the same, don't make again...sorry!",negative

"Way to sweet, it over powered the ribs. Not a good rub for ribs. Pass.",negative

I haven't ever given a one star to a recipe before but this recipe didn't work out at all.

"Hmm. I hate to leave a negative review, but I didn't have a good experience with this recipe. For one, the amounts are all in ""packages"" instead of oz or cups, so I may have had my ratios wrong. I used 16 oz salsa, 10 corn tortillas, and 2 11 oz cans of beans. I cooked it in a 9x13. And while it wasn't _bad_, I won't be making it again. Not enough flavor (maybe mild salsa was a bad idea) and everything stayed very separate, more like a salad than a casserole.",negative

"I hate to be critic, but....I did try this recipe and wasnt very happy with it. Its not like the taste was horrible, but I just didnt like the texture of the patties once they were cooked.",negative
This looks tasty but the sauce is overpowering. It is very strong and almost harsh. All you can smell is ketchup and mustard- you feel like you're at the ballpark. I will admit that we didn't eat ithis- we each tried a bite and called for pizza. Sorry...,negative
This just didn't work for me.A cup of breadcrumbs is a lot. I ended up with scallops covered in dry bread crumbs that baked dry. I took this out of my recipebook.,negative
"I should read more about the recipes I choose.All I saw was the five star recommendation.I cooked the first four ingredients 8 minutes and burned the whole mess.I almost lost a 50 year old bowl, passed down from my Mother.Fortunately, I was able to cool the bowl down and it didn't break.I'll be more careful next time.After it burned, I went back into the recipe and read a comment from ANG18 where she had ruined a dish of her own.",negative

"I have made this recipe several times and I only wish it tasted as good as it smells.Despite adjusting the amount of time I cooked the noodles prior to putting them in the crock pot, the macaroni was very mushy and the dish never got creamy as stated in the recipe.My 14 year old son, who loves mac and cheese, said that what I have made from a box tasted better.Very disappointing!",negative
I assume soda water is seltzer water. I did not like this recipe. Very sour blah blah tasting.,negative
"I have no idea what went wrong with this, but made it to take to Mom's on Christmas day. I started smelling something and kept asking my 25 year old son, if he smelled anything. We kept looking and then found out it was the dip! Had to pitch it and believe me, with all the ingredients, it was an expensive experiment. I'm sorry! I don't know what happened, followed the recipe to a ""T"" (except adding an extra clove of garlic). I don't know if I will be brave enough to try it again, or not.",negative
"I am sorry to say that I was extremely disappointed in this recipe. I used sauteed onions in place of the dried onions, used only one cup of the breadcrumbs, and even added some milk and still found this to be extremely dry. I think that the breadcrumbs are definately the problem. Either the amount is way too much or they need to be breadcrumbs from FRESH bread, not the dried canned variety. ",negative
This was an adequate recipe for muffins.I'm not sure that the final outcome is quite worth all of the steps.I spent at least half an hour on just prep.I'll might use the struesel topping on a different muffin.,negative
"Unfortunately, I did not have any luck with this pie. I made the pie as directed, and baked for a full 45 minutes and the pie was still really ""shakey"". I baked it a little longer but then the crust started burning. The center did not set at all and when it was cut into, the filling spilled out like water. I wonder if there is possibly something missing from the ingredients?? ",negative
"I love seasame seeds and was expecting to really enjoy this dish, but I am sorry to say that was not the case. This was the first time I have ever used seasame oil. We found it's flavor too strong for us in this dish. I think that it may just have been too much of it in this dish. Because we also found it to be too oily as well.",negative
"Anu, I had this for lunch today with white bread. I used 1/2 cup more of water and also added a tsp. of corriander powder, 1/4 cup of green onions and 1/8 tsp red chilli powder. I cooked it in my AMC Dutch Oven(this does not use oil to cook anything in it), so I left out the oil. It was still good( somewhat crunchy). Next time, I'll toss in some curry leaves as well when I put in the mustard seeds and urad dal.UPDATE: In honour of your 20th birthday, I made this yday using in addition to the above ingredients, 1 medium tomato(washed, peeled and chopped) and a whole tsp. of turmeric powder. I omitted the urad dal. I didnt use any coriander powder or green onions this time. I did use 2 whole green chillies(slit). It was amazing how good this tasted. ",neutral
What have I got to say?? I agree with everything the above poster said. I wish her post would have been here before I tried making it...it was nothing AT ALL like the real stuff at Olive Garden! I am with ya Rikki..I have tried to find the original recipe everywhere! ,negative
"How 5 eggs, four cups of sugar, 1/2 a stick of butter and a cup of heavy cream are supposed to fit into a regular pie shell is beyond explanation. A deep-dish pie shell will barely work here.If you make this don't forget to use pie weights when pre-baking the crust. Pie tastes fine but requires much more than a 1/2 hour and 325degrees! Chess pie is supposed to be easier than playing chess. Feh...",negative
"I love cauliflower and was really looking forward to fixing this dish, however, it just did not turn right.Maybe I made a mistake, but I followed the recipe step by step.There was not enough oil to toss the cauliflower with, so I ended up adding some butter hoping it would work out, but it did not.Sorry, I would love to give this a good rating, and I am sure that others enjoyed it, but it did not suit our taste.I really feel bad about this, but I have to be honest.",negative
"This recipe didn't work for me.The amount of rosemary was too overpowering and the sauce was too thick. I used a cabernet - maybe that was the problem with the sauce, the taste just wasn't good.I ended up rinsing off the cooked meat under running water to salvage the roast.",negative
I followed this recipe to the letter and wound up with something resembling coffee flavored cardboard or treebark. One of the worst cookies I've ever had the displeasure of eating. ,negative
this was wayyyy too salty for us.,negative
"I followed directions for this Italian dressing exactly.Used the exact ingredients and proportions listed above... uh... I truly regret giving a less than stellar review... but, this was...wierd tasting.After shaking all ingredients together, it looked omnious.It bears NO resemblance to any Italian dressing I have ever had, whether commercial brand or home-made. After experimental tasting of the finished product, no one in my family would allow me to put this on their salads.(I am so so so sorry!)I'd have to say, though that HeatherDiane's idea of using red wine vinegar could make this a good bit more palatable.",negative
"I was so disappointed with these. Milano's are my ALL TIME favorite cookies. These came out NOTHING like Milano's. These came out soft , not crispy .. so much butter that they are almost greasy. I guess I keep buying the expensive ones ;) ",negative
"If I could give this recipe a lower rating I would. I've never attempted baking bread before so I thought maybe it was just me. But I called my very experienced Grandma, and read her the recipe. She asked me if it was a joke! Unfortunately it wasn't...this stuff was horrible. I don't mean to be rude, maybe the ingredients aren't listed right??? I've had bread similar to this before that was yummy but this couldn't be further from that!",negative
"Incredibly vegetable-heavy, smelly. A waste of good lamb.",negative
"I'm not sure what I did wrong, but my potatoes did not turn out at all. The skins were tough and all wrinkled and in general not very appealing. I have made potatoes in the crockpot before but have wrapped them in tin foil and they turned out fine. I was out of foil so I decided to try this recipe but I just didn't have any luck with it. Sorry.",negative
"I'm sorry, but the combination of things just didn't cut it for us. We went out for pizza. ",negative
Quick and easy but a complete miss with me and my family.It asked for too much cheese and because of this we all found it too cheesey.Maybe I need to use less chess to appreciate this but I don't think I will be trying this on a gain.,negative
"Just didn't do it for me. No flavor, I even added bacon, corn and cheese just so my family would eat it.",negative
"I had really high hopes for this, but it turned out horribly.I followed the measurements and directions precisely, but the salty, hot pineapple flavor was not good and I am not, personally, a big fan of soggy boiled bell peppers.The boiled onions were not a highlight either.We ate a couple bites and threw the rest in the trash.If I were to make this again I would try sauteeing the veggies first and adding them at the end, rather than over-boiling them with the rice and not adding more than a pinch of salt.I think that maybe lowering the saltiness would help the flavor of the pineapple.Sorry.",negative
"This recipe did not work for me.I didn't care for the texture of the chicken breasts and they also were very, very dry.",negative
We did not care much for these pancakes. A box mix or frozen cake would of been better. They just didn't seem to have much flavor.I had some trouble with the recipe. I first started out with the griddle on covered. Had to scrap the first 2 attempts off. Re-read recipe. Went to the electric skillet. Uneven heating. Skillets fault. Ended up thinning the batter a little and using cast iron skillet. ,negative
"We did not like this at all.WAY too much sesame oil/soy/sugar in the pasta.I'd go with 1 cup stock with 1/3 of the other ingredients.The flavor was too overpowering and cloying with all that sugar/salt/sesame flavor.The chicken marinade was way too sweet.It was difficult to cook the chicken without the marinade turning black.Also, the fat content of this dish is very high.In my house, 1 pound of pasta does not feed 10 poeple.Clearly, given the reviews here we are not mainstream in our tastes, but this recipe was a disappointment.",negative
"Yuck.This dish has no flavor.I made it for a supper club I'm in when our theme was Greek Food.It wasn't a hit to say the least.With all the fat in it, as soon as it started to cool off, it solidified.I didn't even try to save some for leftovers.It's kind of an expensive dish (1 lb. of feta cheese isn't cheap!) so I recommend making mac and cheese instead!It costs less and tastes a whole lot better.",negative
"This was easy to make but it just didn't work out for my family.The dish seemed overpowered by the celery,and the poultry seasoning clashed with the ham.(It might be better with chicken).It isn't a pretty dish so I put bread crumbs on top to hide it.We won't be having it again.",negative
"Sorry, didn't care for this.It cooked up a on the dry side, and requires alot of salt and pepper.But even then, it was just lacking in flavor. Maybe some basil or thyme might help.",negative
"One of the main ingredients is missing, which is 1 slice of fresh lime squeezed.",negative
"This is not a TOFFEE, even though its listed as one.It is a cookie type square with chocolate.The cookie base is very hard, I'm one of those people who likes a soft cookie, so this wasn't anything like what I was expecting.",negative
"The rub/marinade was truly misleading...I followed the directions to the ""t"" and even let the pork sit in the fridge over night. The pork was a great color, but had little flavor. VERY BLAND!!! I will not be making this again.",negative
"Sorry Erin, but this dip was a flop at my superbowl party.My family loves to try new things, but we all agreed it tasted too mayonnaisey.Are you sure it was just mayo???No sour cream?",negative
"Yikes! I don't know what I did differently than all the glowing reviews above, but we couldn't even eat these.The garlic was overpowering, and I'm normally a garlic lover!The coating was dry and yet soggy in some spots.Sorry, this one just didn't work out at all for me.",negative
What am I missing here?This puffed up so nicely in the oven and then when it cooled it fell flat and is doughy.,negative
"I made this yesterday ,sorry but I found it only ok. Is there something missing in the cake batter ? It had a nice texture but not much flavor,would try to make it again but would use an extract of some flavor.",negative
"I followed the recipe exactly and the batter was very thin, I baked them for 45 minutes because at 20 they were the consistancy of a just removed from the stove pudding.When they were done, they werent very chocolatey at all rather bland for the amount of work and time put into them.",negative
"I made this for my chocolate loving son's birthday, but was very disappointed with the results.I ended up having to bake the cake for about 80 minutes.Sorry, but we just found this TOO moist, like the cake wasn't baked enough.I sprayed the pan well, as suggested but even after leaving it to cool for almost three hours, I still had part of the cake stuck to the pan.",negative
These were awful!I actually had to throw the leftovers away because my family would not eat them.The recipe would be good without the capers though.They made the cakes taste like a buttery pickle and are what ruined it for us.I’ll keep this recipe and not include the capers next time and see how it turns out. ,negative
How can you have a Pound Cake with no butter and expect something more than marginal results. Nothing to write home about.,negative
"Aagh!It didn't work for me!I may have done something wrong,but I was a little skeptical about a cup of water to only two and a half cups of flour.That's a recipie for library paste.The dough was sticky and hard to roll out.What I really regret is the waste of almost a pound of cheese, not to mention the olives, mushrooms, bell pepper and sausage.I'll stick to my regular plain white bread recipie. Thank goodness there was some cheese left and a can of chicken noodle soup in the pantry.It was not an inspired dinner.",negative
"I found the sauce incredibly salty.In spite of the two cans of tomatoes, I believe that 4 ounces of anchovies as well as the 25 olives contributed a little too much salty flavor to the dish.The 1/4 cup of capers didn't help the situation either.I would try this again, but cut back on the salty ingredients.",negative
"This recipe sounded so wonderful.So I went all out.Dragged out the extra ingredients, and went by all the steps listed here to ""dress up"" our Sunday morning breakfast. I followed the recipe exactly, using the egg yolk rather than egg substitute... It smelled wonderful while cooking and looked festive, too.But the result? Disappointing.I only ate a bite, and my husband and son, who love bacon ate barely a half piece each.Because of the cracker crumb coating, I suppose, the bacon was about 10 times greasier than bacon cooked the usual way.I am so sorry to give a low ratng here, but I do wish I had known how very greasy this bacon would be before I started this recipe, myself...",negative
"It was an easy dish to prepare, but it really lacked any flavor.I was suprised at the out come.If I made it again I would change the hole recipe.",negative
"I had some real problems with this recipe and think some ingredients may be missing from the ingredients list.The batter is very soupy prepared as directed. I noticed there was no flour in the recipe, and I thought to add that to correct the balance. As it turns out, by adding 1 cup of flour to the batter, the consistency looks much better.The cooking time is correct, although turning the bread can prove a bit tricky, so I recommend turning it onto a plate and then sliding it back into the pan.The crust did get very crispy and nicely golden (I used a cast-iron skillet). I would rate this much higher except that it cannot be prepared as directed.",negative
This was the worst cookie I have ever tasted..My mother went to the store to get an ingredient and I was very excited to try this cookie by george cookie.,negative
I would like to see someone else'sreport on this recipe..But would not want anyone to go thru what Ijust did.The batter remained soupyadded 8 tbs more flour still the same..gave up..thru it out.Have had my machine for 4 years..made a lot of bread..never had this happen.the 1 star is for attention.,negative
Very disappointing. Way too strong on the onion. The cream cheese just made it a very heavy dip and masked the avocaco. Not my idea of a good guacamole.,negative
My family really like BBQ sauce but they asked me not to make this again. ,negative
I would not recommend this recipe to true Fetuccini Alfredo lovers or those who do not like fat free cream cheese. The cream cheese gives the sauce an aftertaste that's hard to swallow.,negative
"I thought about not giving a review on these brownies at all, they were the worst brownies we have ever tried. the texture was rubbery,the taste awful.I made them just as the recipe states,but left out the walnuts. the cook time says 35 minutes,it was more like 15 minutes.we wach tried one then threw them away.",negative
My family and I just didn't like it.It was kind of bitter. ,negative

Easy to make but a waste of calories.Very disappointed since I like the combination of chocolate and almonds.,negative
Not very appealing to the eye.Tasted much to strong of the balsamic vinegar as the recipe is.I will not make it again.,negative

I followed the directions exactly and there has been no noticeable difference in my laundry. I'm disappointed. I thought it would work well because it got such good ratings. My towels still smell as mildewy as ever.,negative
"I just hate to give a one star rating!!Everyone in the family tasted this recipe and not one person would eat it.I generally will eat anything vegan, but I just didn't like this one.We actually had to throw it out.I may try this again but use only rice and barley, omit the onions and garlic, use lemon juice, keep the raisins but use apples instead of apricots.Also I would simply omit the sugar.",negative
"I don't even know why I made this because I knew that it's very fattening, but I just didn't imagine how rich and heavy it was going to taste!I only had one little bite and I couldn't eat it anymore...way toooo rich and salty!The broccoli was fine, but the sauce made me feel nauseous!Sorry!",negative
"Mine didn't turn out well. 1. The cake didn't bake for some reason. I thought I followed directions but it just didn't cook in the middle. I'm more of a novice so maybe some ""trick"" I should have known was taken for granted here? I even baked it for an extra 5 minutes (the toothpick always came out with cake on it).I was afraid it would overbake so I finally removed it anyway. Grr.2. The frosting was nice and frothy until I added the sugar and water. It became runny. What did I do wrong? A tiny bit of egg yolk spilled into the whites - could that be it?Anyway, I see that it had a lot of potential but I had to throw it out. I'm new to baking and didn't know cakes were so difficult from scratch. ",negative

it was ok but very plain,negative
I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed in this recipe.I followed the recipe exactly and it was so dry that I couldn't even form it into a ball so had to add extra water in order to roll out the noodles.The noodles were very bland and really didn't have any flavor and ended up thowing it out. ,negative
"I wish I knew how to make this recipe work. The ham and potato combination is a simple pleasure and I was planning on frying the dumplings in bacon drippings. The first time I used Yukon potatoes that I had mashed with some milk so I have some for dinner that night. I found that flouring the counter and my hands made it easier to shape the dumplings and to pick them up because the dough was soft. They fell apart in the water and disintergrated. The second time, I used russets, no milk and extra flour - they fell apart when I tried to remove them from the water at the end of the cooking time and they either disintergrated or were mushy and gluey. I wonder if the dough should be kneaded or chilled? I would love to be able to make these come out right. Sorry Jenny.",negative
"I'm not sure what went wrong but these were.. well.. bad.They tasted like shortening and flour.I added an additional tbsp of orange zest to no avail.I even used fresh squeezed orange juice from wonderfully tasty oranges.If I attempt these again, I'll use butter instead of shortening and some orange extract for added flavor.Maybe I did something wrong?I don't know - I'm definitely not an expert cook but I usually can follow a recipe.",negative
"I'm sorry, but these were not good.I tried these because I was out of eggs.The taste was ok, but the texture was terrible.They came out very thin and mushy.Pancakes need eggs or egg substitute to give them structure.",negative
"I prepared this a very long time ago (when you were in the hospital)..sorry it has taken me so long to review. I found the flavor of this recipe to be based on sugar and chicken. If one likes sugared chicken, this is the recipe for them. However, it was not to my tastes, and I do like sweet food. Sorry.",negative
I was so excited about making this dressing and it turned out horrible.It was waaayyy too tart!Then I started looking at other caesar recipes and realized that your proportions of the mustard and vinegars are way too much for the 8 tablespoons of oil.Maybe the mustard and vinegars are supposed to be 1 teaspoon instead of tablespoons?Sorry!,negative

This recipe had no flavor at all. Would not make again.,negative
"Pass on the potatoes..dont use Worcestershire sauce in the sauce.Make it simple.. just buy the pre-made meatballs ""Armour"" I think is the name brand I use. all you need to do is put the 5 pound bag of meatballs in a pot, pour 2 jars of chilli sauce and one 32 oz of grape jelly simmer for an hour then your ready for a party or get together of up to 25 people.All under 15 bucks.",negative
Recipe lacks clear directions about the consistency of dough. The waffles turned out like bread. ,negative
"I know no other way of saying this, but this did not turn out at all. The cobbler batter was SO thin it poured around the fruit and never rose or firmed up. Even with baking 40 minutes past the bake time. My baking powder was brand new so I know that was not expired. I really wanted this to work. I used some blackberries and raspberries and 2 chopped apples. It smelled wonderful but unfortunately I could not serve it.",negative
"My goodness, I really don't know how to say this, but we didn't like this at all. Instead of using Chicken, I used leftover Christmas turkey and fresh, homemade cranberry sauce. I was really excited to finally find a recipe that would help me use up the leftover cranberry sauce. I followed the recipe to a T and upon tasting the sauce before putting in the crockpot, found that it was very salty tasting, so I added more equal amounts of cranberry sauce and catalina dressing to douse the salty taste of the soup mix. I poured it over the turkey pieces in the crockpot on low for a couple hours til the sauce was bubbly. Maybe it was the combo of flavors, but we just didn't care for it at all. I really love cranberry sauce and thought this would be a winner, but unfortunately for our tastes, it just wasn't. Sorry, I won't make this again and I really apologize for the low rating. I guess everyone's tastes are different. On a positive note, it was very quick to make - took all of about 3 minutes to throw it all together in the crockpot.Edited to add: I noticed Sue L's edit to her review that she tried this in the crockpot and it didn't turn out as well and was runnierthan in the oven.Perhaps that is why mine didn't turn out so great.I'm still a bit surprised about the taste since I used homemade cranberry sauce.Our sauce was not runny from the crockpot, probably because homemade cranberry sauce is thicker than canned, it was just the combo of flavors that didn't work for us.I'm glad that so many others like the recipe. ",negative
I almost didn't review this recipe because I'm embarrassed that I made it.What was I thinking?In the mood for comfort food - thinking this would be good.It was not.It was mediocure at best.Mom always told me if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything but it seems to me the success of this website is that you can generally rely on the reviews - good and bad - and that both are important.Sorry Scandigirl.,negative
We really didn't like this. The bread crumb proportion looked out of the ordinary but I foolishly added the amount stated. I threw it out.My husband wouldn't even take leftovers for his lunch. I'm so sorry CountryLady but this was just awful. ,negative

"This recipe was such a disappointment.I was looking forward to using up some fresh strawberries.Unfortunately, this recipe didn't fit the bill.The directions lack specific guidance (blender) and the cooking time is off for where I live.I baked this pancake for over an hour and it still wasn't ready.If you live in a high-altitude area, be sure to modify the recipe.",negative

"These came out dry and largely flavorless with no sweetness at all.Not remotely what I expected.Putting honey on them made them at least mildly edible, but even so the remaining dough and all I'd made went in the trash.DiB, is there something missing from the recipe?I can't help thinking something isn't right because I followed it exactly.",negative

"Lubie, you and I must have had the same experience. I followed the directions to the tee, but it was so disappointing. I used Martin's Potato bread and used five eggs. What a mushy mess.

This was coming together very nicely and smelled amazing,I have wanted to try this recipe for a long time had very high hopes for this... but mine came out FAR too salty! I could barely get it down and hubby didn't even finish it. Maybe I should have cut back on the soy and worcestershire as many of the others here did, and even probably could have eliminated the 1 tsp. of salt all together as Joy1996 did. I really don't know what went wrong here, I followed the recipe exactly as written. Sorry I could not give more stars, but had to be honest with my review based on my results.",negative
These were so bad we had to throw them away. I am a lifetime Weight Watchers member and many of my friends swear by them. Try it. You may like it.,negative
Must be something wrong with my tastebuds.Tried this recipe on basis of Outback restaurant fame and high starred reviews but thought it was wholly un-memorable. Just canned mushrooms in a bit of juice.,negative
"After reading all the rave reviews for this recipe, I made this last night for dinner.This was not good.I followed the directions exactly.Because of the amount of the vermouth, the soup burned the back of my throat- eventhough it was not hot.Aside from the harsh aftertaste, the flavor of the soup was very bland.I only had two spoonfulls.I would not make this again.",negative
"Didn't care for this recipe.Easy, but tasted too something.I think it was the vinegar, but not sure.",negative
"Sorry folks ... I tried this recipe and it fell woefully short of the mark. I grew up in Winnipeg and had Jeanne's cakes at every family function for years. Now that I live in Florida, I was delighted to see a recipe for the cake and wonderful frosting so that I could have a taste of home. The cake, as described in this recipe, makes a tasty cake but it is more like a pound cake than Jeanne'scake. The base wasn't quite right either. The frosting was close. All in all, an OK recipe for a cake, but if you are looking to replicate a Jeanne's cake, your search isn't over. This recipe doesn't cut it.",negative
"Following the recipe, I got a very rubbery batter. Would like a stronger lemon flavor too.",negative
"I agree with the others that this recipe made allot of liquid. However, I thought the roast had too much of a strong taste of vinegar. We did not like it at all. I would not make it again. Guess it is a matter of taste preference.",negative

No real tomatoes! Too many seasonings that conlict with others,negative
I'm sorry but I found this recipe to be very bland. Not worth all the effort.,negative
I made this for a get together with some family and friends.I was very disappointed with it.The hens were totally bland.I guess I wasn’t the only one who thought so as I noticed my guests all reaching for the salt shaker.I shredded the leftover meat and used it in another dish which turned out much better than this one.,negative
"I don't know what I did wrong,but after creaming the butter and sugar together,I noticed that it wasn't something I could ""press"" into a pan,yet I carried on,and sure enough,the butter melted with the sugar and seperated.Since I had already made the filling,I carried on,after pouring out the butter,but retaining the sugar,and they turned out all right.Will not try these again.",negative
"This just really did not turn out for me.After waiting the 3 1/2 hours for the sweet bread cycle on my machine, I was greatly disappointed.It turned out a big tasteless waste of ingredients. Still a little doughy inside and no chocolate (or any other) taste.",negative
seems a good idea but it didnt make a good meal and was very fatty,negative
i prefered the hush puppies 2. Anyone who wants one of this recipe shouldnt get this one,negative
Sorry - everyone (including me) hated this dish.It was soggy and custardy - not at all what I was expecting.I've made other french toast casseroles that were much better.Even my three year old who loves this kind of thing wouldn't touch it - and he'll eat about anything!Ended up being a grilled cheese night for us.,negative
Not just moist - soggy,negative
"I simply hate it when a recipe says it takes a certain length of time and then you cook for 15 mins more just to be safe and still, the chicken was raw in the middle. I had to microwave it for 4 mins to make sure it was completely cooked. After all that and allowing that maybe my oven doesn't work as well as others, this was a mediocre dinner and one I will not repeat.",negative
"this would not be considered diabetic, with all those carbs!",negative

"I absolutely love bananas and squash, but I found this recipe unpalatable. I will not be making it again.",negative
This did not turn out at all for me.I did everything the recipe said except I used .5% milk which has a slightly higher fat content and it did not thicken at all.It was in the oven for a total of about 1 1/2 hours and still was watery.I actually had to remove some of the milk to get it to thicken up.I would maybe attempt to use this recipe again but definately with carnation tin milk.,negative
"I followed the directions exactly, and ended up with a very hard, unable to dish out, ""jam"".I will have some very unhappy co-workers who were excited about getting this when I canned it.Also, the recipe shows makes 7-8 pints, I got 4 half pints.",negative
The taste and texture was not pleasing to me. I made it exactly as the recipe had indicated and I'm sorry to say that it just didn't do it for me. There was something that I didn't like about the blend of flavours in this dish but I really can't put my finger on it.,negative
"No one in the family liked this much.I love sweets, but this was way too sweet even for me.Guess it should be called sweet cake instead of butter cake.I won't make it again.",negative
"I love hot and sweet things like mango curry etc. Being an Indian, love curries. But this unique recipe was not to our liking. Did not go well with rice or naans. ",negative
This was a major disappointment.I guess when using Zaar I've come to expect a degree of accuracy when it comes to recipes.This one sounds good but if you used the direction to cook at 325 for 1 hour you'll have to like bloody chicken.I don't.The directions did say indicate time may need to be extended for size of chicken.Two hours after I began the chicken it was still not running clear liquid.To top it off the taste was nothing special.Very disappointing.,negative
"This recipe did not work for me at all. The sugar never disolved and so the resulting sauce was very grainy and inedible.I'm wondering if I used the wrong ingredient for the 8oz. of condensed milk.I used 8 oz. of sweetened condensed milk.Sweetened condensed milk is very, very thick and so maybe that is why the sugar never disolved.I'm wondering if the ingredient should have been 8 oz. of EVAPORATED milk.That would make more sense in this recipe since it calls for 2 cups of sugar so you really don't need the extra sugar that is in sweetened condensed milk.Evaporated milk is much thinner and so I think the sugar would disolved.",negative
My family did not care for this AT ALL.We did not like the flavor of the sauce. ,negative
Definately needs sugar ,negative
"It doesn't have a lot of flavor, even after I added garlic powder, salt and cayanne pepper. I even cut down on the sour cream as some posters suggested, but it tastes overwhealmingly of sour cream. I think if there were more onions and less sour cream, or maybe no sour cream?",negative
The sweetness of this muffin was too less for us. It was flavorless despite my adding cinnamon and vanilla. It was just ok out of the oven but really tough and dry the next day. Did not like it at all... ,negative

Not very good.I made this last evening to serve guests tonight.This morning I dumped it and will need to find something else.Don't waste your time.,negative
"I am sorry to say this, since I have enjoyed so many of your other recipes, but this was not all that great. I followed the recipe exactly, no substitutions. The vinegar taste was too strong and didn't mingle well with the other ingredients. The chicken was tender. My children ate it reluctantly, though my husband thought that it could be doctored a bit to improve the flavor. PLEASE keep sharing your recipes, though, everything else I have tried of yours has been super and some are now family favorites!",negative

"This is the hardest meatload EVER to make. It falls apart very easily.The directions are also very confusing. You also have to transfer it from wax paper to tinfoil. Well guess what? The waxpaper is too soggy from the meat to transfer without the meat loaf falling apart. If you want an easy dinner, then DON'T MAKE THIS RECIPE!!",negative
"This was horrible. I honestly do not understand the previous ratings?I served it at a bridal shower without tasting it first - my mistake, I should have known better.It had very low ratings among 13 guests - 12 didn't like it, and one thought it was, ""okay.""Perhaps the other consumers didn't want to give their honest opinions??I don't know, but, I do know that I would not serve this at any social gathering - seriously.",negative
I followed recipe exactly. I had a feeling 1.5 cups of sherry was going to be too much. Wish I had used half or less. Maybe 275-300 for the 3 hrs woulda been better since mine came out sorta tough. I did slice very thin but still not very tender and kinda dry even serving with the roasted mushrooms in the onion soup/sauce. I did use a goog roasting pan with the lid on most of the cooking time. I won't make this again sorry.,negative
"well, i tried this recipe and i ended up with two heavy bricks that tasted like flour and water, and smelled like sourdough.i had never heard of making bread without yeast before, and i loved the idea.i was disappointed, but instead of giving up, i did a little research- you are NOT supposed to put salt on it! it stops the mold, as well as the very bacteria that you are trying to grow.also, you are supposed to add a little flour and water every 24 hours so the yeasts don't die. also, it would've been good to mention that you can use only one cup of the mixture and refrigerate the rest, ""feeding"" it flour and water once a week so you'd have a lifetime supply of sourdough starter..there was a lot of important information left out of this recipe!!",negative
Mixture does not thicken up!!!Used thermometer to get right temperature and mix using low spped - thickest was like ceral cream.And final mixure could not pour - had to be spooned from bowl!!!,negative
"Very unappealing looking when cooked in MW (looked raw, although they were cooked).I opted to toss them in the oven to brown the top a bit, but then they ended up being too dry.",negative
not too bad. but not too good either. it was like a flat cake with carmel.. the sauce was awsome but the dumplings weren't like dumplings at all!,negative
"No, no, no, no, no! 4 cups of sugar? This recipe is for candied cucumbers, not pickles. If you used maybe 1 cup of sugar in this recipe it would still give you a very sweet pickle. ",negative
"Excellent! I used the broiler instead of the oven to both roast the peppers and toast the bread - Watch the bread closely if using the broiler - it's browned in under a minute. I didn't bother to drizzle extra olive oil on the bruschetta and the only time I used salt and black pepper was in the olive oil/bell pepper mixture. Note: The recipe states to use 2 cloves garlic, peeled, but the garlic cloves should be cut in half, with the cut sides rubbed onto the bread. Also, the toasted bread, (I used a French Baguette), should be lightly toasted - more browned on the edges, lighter in the middle. Use a good, soft goat cheese! This is delicious!!! ",positive
"I was looking for something different to make and this sounded very interesting and quite simple. I followed your directions just as written, but these pies didn't turn out well at all. The coffee flavor was way over powering and the the pies themselves didn't set, they were very mushy. I wasn't even able to slice the pie. I would definetely suggest cutting back on the amount of coffee. I'm sorry, to give a bad review, but we just didn't care for this pie at all.",negative
"I thought the combo of soups and beans was strange, but since I saw a 5 star review I decided to try it. The baked beans just didn't go well with it at all, maybe some kind of mexican style beans would work alittle better, but the baked bean flavor just wasn't right. The saltiness from all the soups was almost nauseating. I'm sorry, but nobody here liked it and I had to throw it all out.",negative
"I can't believe that I wrote this review (sept 01) It doesn't even remotely resemble the posted recipe:My dinner turned out great using your recipe but having to change a few things. I didn't have any pineapple so I used a tin of cranberries and instead of pinapple juice I used a tin of condensed Vegetable broth with onions, then adjusted the seasoning to match with the altered ingredients..Oh yes I used country spare ribs. It was enjoyed by all!

eeekk..this is a disaster!,negative
"I was so excited when I saw this recipe and am now so very dissapointed.Let me start by saying thatI have been making jam and canning for over 20 years so I am not a novice.I wondered about how this would set up but went ahead with it anyway. Big mistake.I followed the recipe to the letter and had jars of coconut water. I then returned the mess to the pot and cooked it for at least another hour in hopes of reducing it enough to get it to set. This morning when I checked I still have jars of coconut water, although this time it is a ""bit"" thicker.This is not a cheap recipe to have flop.I guess I will have to find a way to make it into ice cream topping or something so it is not a total waste.Sorry.",negative
We really didn\'t like the texture of this bread because the spinach was pulverized making the bread a grey green color and even though I doubled the cheese as \,negative
Not good - too watery and not thick like a dip.I had to leave it in the oven for 50 minutes or else I would of had to serve it as crab soup.Maybe if you drain the crab meat before you add it you'll have better luck than I did.,negative
"I only give a 1 star if I feel the recipe is poses a danger and I am very sorry to have to do so for this recipe. These did not work out at all for me and I would not attempt them again. The butter started to melt and drip into the fire, causing the flames to shoot up higher.This was very dangerous and both my husband and daughter got burnt using this method.We have been roasting marshmallows for many years and this was the only time I had this happen.Our grill flames were very low and I did not put tons of butter on the marshmallows, just enough to coat them.I did get to eat mine,and it tasted much the same as those grilled without butter.",negative
"Mine was a total flop.The mixture came out too dry and didn't hold together.I tried putting it in a cake pan to slice when cool, but it's just crumbs that don't hold together.Maybe some variations in peanut butter?I'm going to try adding some eggs and flour and bake the dough.I'm VERRY disappointed.",negative
Very dry and way too lemony!,negative
"Batter was so stiff you could have made cookies with it, never mind trying to spread in pan!!!!And was dry with no water or oil - hard to mix and came out flat looking!!Will not make EVER again!!!!",negative
"I'm sorry I have to rate this so low- I had really high hopes for it.But it was just inedible- the flavors were off and tasted bad, and it looked unapetizine as well.I used wide rice noodles because I thought they might hold the sauce better.I followed the recipe exactly.It was just not good- We ate a tiny bit and had to throw the rest out.Sorry- I don't know what went wrong.",negative
"I agree with ladypit,it was'nt very tasty and refreshing,maybe something was missing,at least some lemon wedge. I personnaly find that is many all made lemonade powder that are great and easy to prepare. CRYSTAL is one,I always had more water and lemon juice and wedge (or lime).",negative
"I wish I could be more generous with this recipe, because the theory was sound - just didn't work in practice.The brown rice provided a 'mustiness' that I think didn't work in this pudding, and after cooking, the buttermilk left a strange graininess in the mouth.I found that I really had to watch my pot because after the first 10 minutes of cooking (at the lowest setting on my stove-top), the pudding had a tendency to scorch on the bottom.It was done after 20 minutes.Unfortunately, it was not creamy - more stodgy, and very, very solid, even while still warm.The cherries just couldn't save it.Unfortunately, nobody in the family liked it and I ditched it as I know it would just not get eaten.",negative

"Sorry... this method didn´t work for me at all... After 2 days, it separated in the container, became orange, and started to smell awful (not like any sourdough starter, but more like a mix between a gym\'s bag and cat litter...).

"I was EXTREMELY disappointed with this recipe. It sounded so good. I could not wait to serve this to my family. Unfortunately I wasted top quality beef on this one. The flavor was so ""blah"". The lemon juice was overwhelming. The whole family had to spread BBQ sauce over it to eat it. I marinated it over night in hopes of getting the flavor throughout the meat. Very disappointed!!!

This recipe needs more liquid in order for the rice to cook and I also think that 8 hours on low may be a bit long for zucchini. Sorry this just didn't work out very well for us.,negative
"I don't know what happened, but this recipe turned out to be a complete disaster for me.First off, the ingredients didn't fit in the blender (and I don't think my blender is a small one) so I had to do the mixing in turn.But worse, for some reason the pie just did not bake correctly.I had to bake it till the crust scorched (it is like cardboard) and the inside is still runny.I've re-read the recipe several times to try to figure out what I did wrong and can't tell that I did anything incorrectly.My husband will eat anything, so I guess it won't go to waste, but this one is definitely not something I'd make again.",negative
"I tried the chilled version for breakfast this morning, and was very disappointed. It was watery and tasteless. I tried zapping it for a minute in the microwave, which did thicken it up, but it was still bland. I added a little sugar and some milk, and managed to eat it, but I certainly won't make it again. I'm sorry...it seems like such a good, time-saving idea.",negative

Smells better than it tastes,negative
"My husband and I are on a low carb diet, and I had been craving lemon pie.I made the filling as written using Splenda instead of Equal. I even added extra sweetener.

This recipe was AWFUL! It tasted only like vinegar. I would not recommend this recipe. ,negative
needs more instruction.,negative
"This is the first one star rating I've given.This recipe did not work at all, and I followed it to the letter.It is missing something to make it thicken, which I believe to be flour or even a cornmeal/flour combo.Made it for company and was so embarrassed it didn't turn out and I'm so disappointed.Please revise and resubmit so no one else has ""egg"" on their face like I did today!",negative
"This whipped up beautifully in the blender but when I drank it, I got a very bitter after taste",negative
"7/12/04 - I agree with the other reviewer- I had to add another tsp of cornstarch to get from hot cocoa consistancy to sauce. I used half coffee and half water. This has too strong of a cocoa flavor for me- it tastes a little too much like eating straight cocoa powder, and I did add more sugar than called for to try and compensate for this. Maybe I will try adding some more vanilla or something. I just added a spoonful to my coffee to make a cafe mocha for myself, which worked pretty well (still a little bitter). I was hoping for sort of a Hershey's syrup substitute (since I know that is fat-free, too), but this falls a little short. The texture is kind of funny, kind of like pudding, but if I hadn't added that extra tsp cornstarch, it would just be liquid. I will try and tinker with this and make it more palatable, but I would not make this again. 7/28/04 - Sorry, but I decided that I really had to re-review this.I found that I could not save the flavors of this sauce, no matter what I added.But also upon refrigerating, it seperated- so there was liquid and a lump of cornstarchy solid stuff.I ended up just throwing it out.Sorry- I had really high hopes for this recipe, but it simply did not work out for me at all.",negative
"Sorry, but we really didn\'t think this was a very good dressing. It took a lot of doctoring up to where we could use it. I don\'t think recipes using soy sauce need additional salt. We added some sesame oil, fresh ginger, brown sugar,green onions andcilantro. Then it tasted pretty good. But to each his own, this clearly had good reviews, which is why I chose it. I would however, compliment your suggestion to toss the cooked chicken in that Yoshida\'s marinade. That part was very tastey.",negative
The concentrate was too overpowering. The fresh taste of watermelon was lost.,negative
"I hate disagreeing with so many, and to each his own, but no one in my family liked these with the cream cheese filling.We\'ve had them many times without, and they\'re a favorite, but the cream cheese just seemed to add calories and lots of goo.I felt it actually took away from the flavor of the rolls.

"Unsafe - This uses the old, outdated 'Open Kettle' method, and poses a serious health risk - particularly in low-acid foods. In this process, the food was packed into sterilized jars and sealed. The theory was that the heat from the food was sufficient to create a vacuum seal in the jar without further processing. Many old recipes passed down through the years, or those found in older cookbooks, use the old-time, outdated canning directions for the open kettle method. This method is now considered unsafe because we now know that without heat processing, bacteria, yeast and mold contamination is common. The growth of these microorganisms, in addition to spoiling the food, often caused lids to later become unsealed.

Sorry to say I had to throw it out.My family didn't like the over-powering mustard taste.,negative
Taste just like a biscuit but fun for kids.,negative
"What a waste of money!!!I made this according to directions.The mint was way too overpowering, even without the mint it would have been bad.",negative
"Sorry, just didn't like this dish.Tried a version of it with chicken and loved it.",negative
"What a mess!! Batter would not stick to fish, and pan was spitting oil all over oven! Will not use this again.",negative
This unfortunately was very bland. It was missing something. I was surprised to find that after 5 hours that the chicken was tough. May taste great for some but I dont think I will make this again.,negative

If you use balsamic vinegar this will be a nasty brown mess.,negative
Way too sweet,negative
"I'm sorry, but these were not cookies.Tough, kind of like taffy with a hard crunch that sticks to your teeth.They did come together easily and look like cookies, but it's not much harder to add an egg and flour for real peanut butter cookies.I will not be making these again.",negative
"I have the feeling that one or more ingredients are missing from this recipe. Moreover, the spice ombination is rather unusual in Middle Eastern Cooking, certainly in a lentil soup, and it is an unfortunate one since it it imparts a strongly medicinal and unbalanced flavor to the soup.I would have expected at least one or two large onions and perhaps some tomato and double the lemon juice in this soup plus perhaps some (Ceylon) cinnamon or even cloves to ameliorate and warm the flavors of the other spices.In any event, there is far too much spice and salt in this recipe, especialy if one uses fresh, high quality spices.",negative
The recipe works fine as long as you do two things: 1)Use the Betty Crocker DRY frosting mix and 2)Use 16 oz of confectioner's sugar which is 2 cups.,negative
"This recipe just didn't go over with my taste buds. I used 3 different chili spices and while one was way to hot, the other two just didn't win with me either. Just personal preference. I won't make this one again.",negative
Worcestershire sauce has NOTHING to do in a real swiss fondue!!! It's like putting ketchup on a sushi!,negative

"What a disaster!!!!! Pudding NEVER turned brown on top, and was mushy after following direction exactly!!!A waste of time - as was the cake -and this recipe!!!Will never make again > would suggest same to anyone thinking about trying this!!!",negative
"I'm sorry but I just did NOT like these, nor did my husband or my son.It was a waste of money and asparagus isn't cheap.I had to add water to the bread crumb mixture because it was too dry to even form patties.It also mostly tasted like the crumb mixture rather than asparagus and the pieces kept sticking out.Husband thought they were bland, son spit out.I should've stuck to the plain stalks to feed him cause he was eating them fine when I cooked them before making the patties.",negative
"This unfortunately did not work out for me at all. I was unable to achieve a smooth sauce with a well balanced flavor and texture, despite measuring carefully and adding lots of hot water in small batches.I also was greatly disappointed in the flavor.I had orignally shared this recipe for a request, but asked the Elves to remove it from my account because I had such poor results once I tried it. Perhaps you will have more luck than I did at improving this - I cannot recommend the current version.",negative
"This was not very good, rather blah-ish.",negative
"While easy to make, the end result was disappointing.We found it lacked in taste.If I were to make it again, I would substitute the chicken broth for beef and find a zippier soup, such as tomato or the like.",negative

"I'm sorry, but I followed the recipe exactly, and I found this sauce grainy and quite bland.",negative
"This recipe is flawed.One cup of flour is not enough and when more is added just so the logs can be formed, the taste is lost.It has good intentions, but it is not Biscotti.Flavored cardboard is a better discription.",negative
"Not a true Banoffie - where is the Toffie element!This is just a condensed milk, banana and cream cake!!",negative
Ok,negative
"I am sorry to give any recipe low marks, but I want to be honest. After reading all the glowing reviews, I was just sure this would be a winner. Unfortunately, it was a dissappointment.I followed the recipe to a T. Didn't change a thing. It did make a huge amount.7 of us went through about 1/4 of the pan. The problems seemed to be that it was NOT creamy, and pretty bland. Perhaps using extra sharp cheddar (as some reviewers suggested) and maybe the mild mexican velveeta would liven it up some. Although to its credit, our 4yr old and 6 yr. old did like it. My husband found that it was more palatable if he added some corn and salt to his. We served it with corn, biscuits and a green salad.But clearly, I'm in the minority here. Most other reviewers seemed to like it. ",negative
"These were so horrible they could not be eaten.First they did not rise at all and secondly after 15 minutes the bottoms were brown but not the tops and the middle was gooey.Worst of all they had a very sour taste.Could that be because the amount of cream of tartar is wrong?Or, could it be that the unsalted was old?It did not look right when I took it out of the box.",negative
"I hate to give this recipe such a low rating since I see everyone else liked it, but I don't see what all the hype is about. The dish came out bland, really bland. I ended up throwing it away. Maybe it's because everyone else used peanut butter and I used tahini, or maybe because everyone else added additional ingredients. I don't know. ",negative
"I'm not quite sure what happened, but this didn't turn out at all. It was so hard and sticky, not at all what I had expected. I halved the recipe, and that might have been what the problem was. I might try it again with heavy cream like KatieLynn did.",negative
"Sounds nice but this is not authentic Lebanese. 1st. This is a lenten dish where butter has no place. 2nd. Simmering lentils with rice for 1-2 hours will end up in a mash. 3rd. Broth and onion soup mix will put the final touches to this dishe's ruin. Sorry, but this is a traditional Lebanese recipe that has suffered Chinese Whispers!",negative
What did I do wrong?I'm pretty sure I followed the directions exactly...they were inedible!!!,negative
I'm sorry but this was disliked by my family and I had to throw most of it away.,negative
I hate to be the bad apple in the bunch but my entire family was very disappointed. We thought the flavor was too bland. It needed some seasoning or something. I ended up heating some soy/ginger sauce up and pouring it over it so that we could eat it. Very disappointed. ,negative
There is NO kiwi in recipe!These are chocolate chip cookies - no fruit ingredients listed!,negative
"What a disaster! The center of this cheesecake would not set no matter how long I left it in the oven.I used 25% less fat cream cheese, so that was not the problem.The flavour was nice but 90% went down my garberator.Luckily I made this for family (bad enough) and not a special occasion.Do not waste your time or money - there are too many good cheesecake recipes out there.",negative
"Although I was looking forward to making this recipe, I was very disappointed.The bars were very grainy/gritty due to the brown sugar.Perhaps the sugar step is incorrect in instructions.",negative
I made a 40 jars of these pickles and they turned out way to salty.I really like salty pickles and these were way to salty for me. Yuck!They had to be thrown out.I would not use cider vinegar again.It gave these pickles an awful smell.,negative
"Sorry, I just did not like this recipe.I felt if I was going to the trouble of making something for my soup then ordinary matzo meal knaidlach are much nicer.",negative
Sorry I didn't like this recipe as I found it bland and uninteresting.I think that a tuna/tomato mix just doesn't work and they seem to ancel themselves out. Also there are not enough interesting spices to make up for that fact.Sorry but i won't be using this one again.,negative
"Well, I tried to reach the chef on this recipe, but there was no response.I think that the proportions are off cocoa:sweetner.I followed it to the letter and had to add almost 1/2 C of milk just to mix it, it was so dry.When I baked it it was very ""cocoa-ey"" instead of sweet/chocolatey.I really wanted this to work, but no go!Sorry!",negative
"UGH...20min?I only put these on for 10 min in a 350 degree preheated oven, trying to anticipate for possibly needing to stir the almonds halfway through cooking to prevent burning or maybe just in case 20min was too much.10min was too much!They burnt!By the time i smelled something was wrong it was tooo late to salvage them.How exactly do you toast slivered almonds for 20min without totally burning them?I trusted this recipe because I'm a very novice cook, and they totally ended up ruining my almonds for my salad.I don't mean to blame you by giving you such a low rating, but I figured you might know better than me how to do this.Sigh... I'm not even able to get to the store to buy more.I'm part of the honest-reviews petition, so that was my honest review, disappointed and confused why the time/temp burnt my almonds.",negative
"It could be very well my mistake but the pie turned out to be an awfully watery one.In spite of the fact that I reduced the milk and added an extra package of vanilla pudding and eliminated the vanilla extract which would’ve given more liquid to the mixture.When I finished the filling with my modifications it was still much more watery than I would expected from a pie filling.I had to bake the pie for an extra 25 minutes on 350 Celsius and was still way too “liquidy”.I thought it is better if I keep baking it for an extra 25 minutes on 300.When I gave up baking, it was still undone inside and black on the top.The result was a soaked pie crust with a still watery inside and an unattractive burnt top.I would not do it again.But I am very curious that how it could be done with a good result.I am sorry Miss Annie to give you such a bad review.As I told it before it might be my fault that it was not a success.",negative
I'm really sorry - but - blech....This was not very good at all.After 3 hours it was a complete mush.It literally looked like mushy applesauce (and I even sliced my apples extra thick because we like them with a little bite in them)with a really thick layer of brown mush on top.The edges burnt and had to be scooped away.We figured we would try to salvage it with some ice cream - and it still wasn't very good.There was way too much flour and it just does not turn out right...Sorry!,negative
"My muffins turned out to be muffin balls, then I realized I forgot to add the oil! Even still they weren't that bad, but a little on the bland side. Perhaps some nugmeg would have added more flavor.",negative
"My kids tasted and threw it away.I'm so disappointed, too because I can't get canned tomato soup where I live.My usual soup, made with tomato paste, onion, red pepper and sugar in 2 hours on the stove top is far far better.",negative
"Sorry, these didn't work for us.These neither tasted good nor smelled good.DH loves radishes and Mexican and could barely eat 1 bite.I couldn't even eat 1 bite.The red skin looked acid eaten so they weren't overly appealing to the eye.No way for me to help this recipe.",negative
"Braunda, I'm really sorry to give only one star for this recipe that so many people seem to enjoy. I followed the directions exactly as posted, but I'm wondering if I didn't do something right. My husband, children and I didn't like the taste of this dish. I had to throw away the pot and make sandwiches for everyone. Many people seem to enjoy this meal, so maybe it was something done wrong at my end. Thank you for sharing though.I do look forward to trying out another one of your recipes.",negative
I tried this for my diabetic brother-in-law and was very disappointed.The cobbler did not envelope the apples. The batter when cooked was very tough almost like the back of pizza crust. The flavor was OK but the toughness was terrible.,negative
"I made this recipe as posted without any changes and we did not care for this at all.We have had cauliflower as mashed potatoes before and we liked it a lot, but this just wasn't for us.I don't know if I added too much parsley or to much chives, but we didn't eat but a bit or two.Sorry Marie but we will not be making this again.",negative
"I am sorry to have to give a one-star but there is something wrong with this recipe as written.In Step 3 it says ""add the eggs"", yet there are no eggs in the ingredient list. I assumed ""eggs"" to mean ""two eggs"" and carried on with the recipe. Other than this, i followed the ingredients and instructions EXACTLY. The resulting batter looked like cake batter.... i should have known better than to try and bake it... should have added lots more flour and/or oats, maybe could have salvaged it... anyhow, i didn't, and it remained bubbling runny pudding well after the 20 minutes was up. Never did set.... poured it out and went without dessert tonight. ",negative
The lemon/white wine was overpowering and made the chicken bitter. A definite NO,negative
"I really don't like to critize what other people make and I don't know if I did something wrong although I followed the recipe, but neither my husband or myself liked this recipe.Everybody's tastes are different so it might be good to others but I suggest tasting the sauce before adding it to your food just in case.Luckily I did as I don't think we would have eaten the food it was added to.. sorry.",negative
"I am also a dental hygienist and am cautioning everyone not to use this recipe as is. If you care to make your own paste, use only the baking soda and OMIT the salt completely. Baking soda is smooth and will buff your teeth while salt is extremely abrasive and will scratch the enamel.You will find after a time that your teeth will begin to stain in the microscopic scratches, and you will be scrubbing off more of your enamel to get rid of them. You may also find that your teeth become sensitive from removing the protective enamel and eventually you will be removing the softer root surface which will add to the sensitivity and cause further gum recession and make you more prone to cavities . Salt is very goo for reducing inflammation and healing of tissues but ONLY if first dissolved in warm water and used as a rinse. Never to scrub your teeth with. As a test take both salt and baking soda between your fingers...salt has sharp pointed crystals and baking soda is smooth. You would loose the benefit of the strengthening fluoride also. Use the baking soda if you wish, but I would not reccomend using it exclusively. Teeth aremeant to last a lifetime and you would be compromising your smile and your oral health if you used the salt in this recipe. ",negative
"this is the first recipe on here which me and my family did not like. after putting all the ingredients together the batter was very stiff, so added a bit more liquid, and when they were done we tasted them and it tasted nothing, very flat flavor, so we tried 4 and the rest went in the garbage, not a recipe we will be keeping.",negative
"I tried this recipe and the result was almost totally inedible.It was NOT dry, it was boiled into a football. (""Cook slowly"" gives no indication of time, and there was not a moment of ""fork tender""ness throughout the process.)If I had known how much time to give it, etc., I wouldn't have been looking for a recipe.The baking dish version might have worked better, but I had such a bad experience with the main version that I'm not tempted to waste another expensive buffalo steak finding out. ",negative
I did not like this one bit! Had no flavor.. just hot!,negative
"Yuck,This pie didn't set up at all.Tasted pretty bland too.Skip it.",negative
"I am so sorry that this pie did not work out for me. I had looked forward to it, and although it smelled wonderful while baking, there were several problems. I didn't find that the filling got cooked through even though the crust was golden, and I think the initial high temp may have had something to do with that. Also, the pie was filled to the brim with liquid when I took a slice out- like it was swimming. I did think the amount of filling was a lot, but I managed to get the pie crust around it- barely (I used Pillsbury ready-crust as suggested, but would rather go with home made as the crust was not very good and part of it fell off the pie while baking). Also, I used the full 1 1/2 cups sugar and found that the pie was excessively tart, probably due to the cranberries. I am sorry to give such a low rating, but I wanted to be honest. ",negative
"I have baked a lot of German Kuchen recipes, but never one with “condensed milk” in the yeast dough.I thought I’d give it a try anyway.The dough was heavy as a brick mixing it up, but I followed though the directions.After taking it out of the refrigerator and kneading it, I set it aside to rise.After 2 ½ hours and it didn’t budge, I knew this was going to be a waste but baked it anyway.It was too dry to even eat (but smelled delicious)the whole thing went into the trash.Could it be that it called for “Evaporated milk” and not condensed milk? It sounds so good otherwise!",negative
"I never could get this to set.I baked it for an hour and 25 minutes.Had to throw the whole pan out.I went back to see if I had left something out, which I did leave out the green bell peppers, so I'm not sure what happened.Something didn't seem right when I was putting it together.Sorry",negative
"When I made this recipe for my family, I had to come up with something else quickly.No on e in my family would eat it.The entire dish tasted like tarter sauce.For some reason eating potatoes that taste like tarter sauce just seems wrong.",negative

"This did not turn out at all for me.Made the mistake of trying it with a CROWD at our home and not reading the prior reviews.Cook time was really off, fell apart, looked like hash.Maybe I went wrong somewhere.Was really hoping for a crockpot meatloaf recipe as we,during the summer, have a house full each weekend.In order for me to join in the fun and still have something at the end of the day we use crockpots all the time.Will keep looking!",negative
"There wasn't very much flavor, and it was so chewy it was like having your jaw wired. I will continue looking for another recipe.",negative
Sorry but the curst looks as if it has been over cooked. And would be a bit hard and not flaky.,negative
This was so incredible rich it was almost inedible.Too salty too and i'm a salt freak.Maybe leaving out the onion soup mix would help.Not sure.But be prepared for not only a very rich dish but heavy on the calories.The potatoes and cheese are not included in the calorie count.,negative
"I really hate giving such a low review but, here goes.First off, this meal was far, far from 'simple' to make.It was a slimy mess.Secondly, if anyone says that these were cooked after 5 minutes per side, they are either lying or they have a nuclear powered grill.It actually took about 45 minutes altogether, and, of course, by that time they were falling apart, the bacon was burnt to a crisp, and most of the cream cheese had oozed out.I think that it should be specified as to how thick these 'cube steaks' are supposed to be, and how big, because I got a disgusting, oozing, gross mess of garbage that took me an hour and a half to make and 2 seconds to throw away, because they tasted horrible.We ended up going out for dinner.I have A LOT of experience cooking, so I am 100% certain that the results were not due to some kind of error on my part.Please do everyone a favor and get more specific in how thick and how large the steaks are...apparently it makes a HUGE difference.",negative
Have to agree with some of the previous comments - the butter needs to be cut down.,negative
"I made this because of all the rave reviews. It seems I am the only one to put in a negative review. I don't like to hurt anyones feeling with a bad review, I made this several months ago and wasn't going to put in this review but feel I should because there may be others like me that don't like the overpowering smell of alcohol and ammonia.I made this exactly as stated. I didn't find it cleaned well at all. The smell of alcohol and ammonia is enough to make one stop breathing. I would rather spend a little extra and get a good smelling store bought cleaner that works without excessive scrubbing. ",negative
"I'm sorry, but I followed the directions exactly. The chicken was extremely tender, but the taste was worse than bland. I am using the leftovers in a casserole tonight. I will use the general idea again, but put seasoning on the chicken first. Thanks for sharing your recipe; maybe it's just a difference of taste!",negative
Neither my kids or my husband were dazzled by this.I made a pot pie out of the leftovers but the initial chicken was not a winner,negative
"They taste like margarine and sugar balls.Even if you think that sounds delish, (as my brother did) trust me, they're disgusting.",negative
I tried this. Nobody in my family like it. Way to much molasses. Had to throw it all away!,negative
We did not really care for this recipe.Something was missing - like more seasonings.I prepared exactly as the recipe is posted except my instant mashed potatoes had directions for 6=7 servings.I used freshly grated parmesan reggiano and the finished dish looked like the photo.The top crust was a tough texture.We'll not try again.,negative

"YUCK!!!I was going to use this recipe to make my own wedding cake, and boy was I wrong!I don't know if I made it wrong or what, but all the texture tasted like was the Crisco!!!Good thing I made a practice cake first, I had to throw the whole thing away because I couldn't stand it.Definitely a learning experience -- never make a homemade frosting if it calls for Crisco!Yucky!",negative
These really did not turn out as great as every one says .. Yes do leave out the ketchup.,negative
"I followed the directions exactly, and I'm sorry to say that this dessert tasted terrible! It took much longer to cook, therefore it was dry. Plus there was no taste to the brownies, very bland. I couldn't even get my kids to eat it.",negative

"I had to add more flour, about 1/2 cup.Still was very sticky.Also did not have a strong peanut butter taste.Just tasted sweet.Will not make again.",negative
Sorry but this recipe just didn't do a thing for me. Guess I'm not a tarragon lover as it went fine until I added the herb.I even put in a tin of cream of chicken soup to try and kill the overpowering tarragon taste to no avail. It got dumped in the garbage.,negative

"I'm really sorry but we didn't like these at all.They were very bland and almost floury, and the baking soda taste really came through.After my first batch came out of the oven, we tried to doctor up the rest of the dough with more cinnamon and sugar and it made them edible but I won't make them again.

Okay...I thought about not even posting a review...but I didn't feel that was right.I'm sorry but hubby and I didn't care much for this...something just wasn't right.The flavor was not what we had thought it might be.Others have enjoyed it so it must just be OUR tastebuds.,negative
"Well, this was a disappointment. I followed all the instructions (though since they already didn't hold together well then, I put them in the fridge before putting them into breading), but once I put the cakes in the eggmixture, most of them broke into bits, so putting them in breadcrumbs and the egg and the breadcrumbs again is far too much handling. So I dropped one step of breadcrumbs. Inspite of leaving them again in the fridge during the frying process, most of them dissolved again and soaked up a lot of fat. I drained them on a paper cloth and served the pancakes with the salsa (not very convincing taste either, I'd definetely leave out the vinegar- it makes it far too sour). I hoped that the taste would at least make up for all the pains I went through, but honestly I really didn't think it was worth it. Too fatty. Considering the time spent and result obtained, I'm really sorry, but I had better results with spending less time in the kitchen ( a less messy kitchen too). When I read the ingredients list, I really thought this might be sth really nice, but as I made this it just wasn't near to what it suggested. It also smelled good during the frying, but unfortunately the taste wasn't anywhere near the smell.",negative
"Angie, Sorry but this was a bust for DH and me. Followed the method and ingredients exactly except for using chicken broth instead of vegetable. You are right, the aroma is certainly pungent while cooking! But all the expected flavor wasn't there. DH thought it might be the type of potatoes I used but I did use russets as that was what you specified in the recipe. Sorry, but this is not a ""keeper"" for me. ",negative
"Paula, I'm sorry to say that this recipe totally didn't work for me. Other than omitting raisins (because my kids won't touch them), I followed this recipe exactly. I ended up topping it off with brown sugar the next day because there was no sweetness at all to it. I thought the plain yogurt added a bit of bitterness to it because there wasn't enough flavoring to offset it. No one here would eat it. One bite and they were done. I hate to rate low and I'm sorry this particular dish didn't go over well on this end, but I do look forward to trying another one of your recipes. Thank you for posting.",negative
Sorry but this pie is not worth making. I also dislike the syrupy pecan pies but this one looks like pecans sitting on mashed potatoes and is very bland. I followed the recipe exactly.,negative

"This microwave method is the worst way to try to cook butternut squash.I pierced, zapped for 8 min and then cut open.It was cooked in some spots but very raw in the rest.(most)I scooped out the seeds,and the cooked part (to save)and re-zapped for another 10 min.Again, the same problem.Cooked in some spots but not in others.Re-zapped another 5 min (after scooping out the ""cooked"".Still had some raw spots.I finally gave up and threw out the raw.This was taking far more time than the 8 min. I expected. I cannot blame my microwave.It's a GE Atvantium.I tried again with another squash. This time I set the initial time for 20 min.Again same problem , gave up and threw out the raw portions.I am so dissapointed!I was so mad that I did not go to step 2.I took what I had and added brown sugar and butter to taste and whipped with an electric mixer.Turned out great but I will NEVER microwave squash again.Too time consuming and too much waste",negative

"This has to be one of the very worst recipes I have ever tried. I always go with four star recipes but I wanted to try this one because I wanted a no-bake pumpkin cream cheese pie for Thanksgiving. I wondered why this one had no stars but I know Nurse Di's recipes are normally very good, so I decided to try it anyway. The problem is that the instant pudding/pumpkin layer never set up. What a mess!! I worried when it said to only beat for a minute and to pour into the pies hell. I knew it wouldn't set but did it anyway. Six hours later still runny so I poured it out and tried to beat some thickness into it. No luck so I threw it out. I wish those of you who have tried this recipe had given it a proper review so others could prevent a huge disappointment!!!",negative

"Followed recipe EXACTLY as stated. Why didnt I brown the meat first?I dont know, I know better than that.Anyway this meat had the consistency of dog food.I had Wendy's the night I made this.If you do decide to make this.Do not use flour, use more spices, use more water, and cook longer.This was a disaster.I do NOT recommend this to anyone.",negative
too nutty and sticky. NOT IMPRESSED!!!,negative
"This was a total failure for us. I made it this morning and it does require effort, that's ok, but when the end result is so bad, it makes you want to cry! This made 19 dumplings for me. I used 1 1/2 cups of fresh grated coconut {3 cups was way too much} and the other ingrdients as stated here. Once done{steamed}, the rice flour tasted like I was chewing on rubber! Not just that, it was not tasting sweet. It was not a dessert from any angle. More like a punishment! I didn't want to throw it all away as I'd spent so much time and effort on this. So, I had to boil 3 cups of full cream milk with 6 tbsps. of sugar and few green cardamoms, powdered, and then add the steamed dumplings to it. Thereafter, I served half batch immediately and people who ate it told me they liked it now and in particular enjoyed spooning some of the milk into the dumpling after breaking it open with a spoon, and then eating it. The other batch, I let it cool completely, and then covered and kept it in the refrigerator to chill. Those who had this chilled said it was nice now. One thing's definite: I am never ever going to make this again! ",negative
I'm sorry - I didn't like this. It mostly tasted like dry mustard mixed with water.,negative
"I'm sorry, but it was very very bitter for me too.I used sugar free/fat free pudding.I'm wondering if that was the problem.Sorry!",negative
"I was worried about using strawberries because of excess moisture in this recipe but it sounded so good that I tried it. I used whole frozen strawberries, thawed, which I weighed so I know the amount was correct. The rice krispies turned to mush when I stirred them in. Please let me know if the recipe needs to be modified or if you have any suggestions. Actually, I think without the strawberries, the recipe would be quite good and I really like the idea of using white chocolate on top. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like it.",negative
I wasn't a big fan of this recipe. I don't think I would make this again,negative
"I found these cookies the worst ever.I followed the directions exactly.The dough came out crumbly, I even chilled It for longer than an hour.The dough that formed was good for 5 cookies.It was a waste of time and energy and I was not crazy about the taste.",negative
"I read the reviews and had my hopes up.I didn't change anything about the recipe and sadly it let me down.I tried it again the next day thinking the longer it sat the better everything would blend.The next day it was unfortunately just as bad as it was at first.It was easy to make but nothing seemed to go together.The tomatoes, beans and chicken just did not mix.It sounded good but the reality just didn't meet my expectations.",negative
"1 Hour before I was to serve this soup to a Christmas gathering of friends, I had to completely rework it...it lacked taste, the cheese had curdled and it was like paste. Needless to say, I was looking for a simple, quick recipe and all I found was a mess!! This recipe has been removed from ""my cookbook"".",negative
"Sorry, but this really didn't work for me. I couldn't roll out the dough at all, even though I did everything as directed. I even tried chilling it for much longer, but ended up chucking it away and starting all over again with a different recipe for cut-out cookies.",negative
"Was there a typo here or some instructions missing?Reread several times to find out where I went wrong......this was HORRIBLY salty, a total waste of ingredients in my opinion. Maybe it should have read ""2 TEASPOONS BOULLION?"" Also, how did you come up with 51 grams of fat in the nutritional info?There is no fat in my potato flakes, none in the powdered milk, none in the boullion and certainly none in the seasonings?",negative

"Wonderful recipe. I served these with BBQ'd Lamb and everyone loved them. I used Balsamic vinegar. Thanks for a nice addition to my favorite recipes — posted Jul 23, 2001, Additional comments- I baked the onions separately in large muffin tins and cut the baking time to 25 minutes lightly covered and 15 min uncovered.

"Sorry, my crackers were a huge disappointment. I used salted or regular butter and one TBL SP of brown sugar. My crackers tasted like hot salty butter with some whole wheat in it.

This was years ago.",negative

I think if I used 2 TEASPOONS of each, it would come out ok.I had to throw it out and 3 hours before company was coming throw something else together using canned beans. ",negative
Consistency was too soft.Great if you don't mind Cheese Cake Soup.,negative

Although the recipe is no more difficult to make than any other yeast bread...the dough makes a very stretchy---way too chewy--- almost like it has gum in it pizza crust! I try lots of recipes without having problems and will not try this again! I am going to stick to the recipe I have from Cook's Illustrated Italian Cookbook. I tried lots of crusts to find one good enough and adaptable to the toppings we like. With the health problems I have I avoided eating it. I am sorry to the person posting this recipe! I have no suggestions as to what could be done to improve it. I know we all have different tastes and opinons so maybe some will like it...just not us. January, 2005 ",negative
"Sorry, but no matter how long I kept these in the pan they never seemed to be done.The comments I got from others were, THEY'RE NOT DONE. I guess we prefer fluffier, instead of mushier. The flavour was ok, but I won't make these again.",negative
This may be low carb but definately is not anything close to a frappuccino.If making this try using your favourite additive to get a better taste. ,negative
I found this recipe on another site and made it this past wkend for my boys who adore both doughnuts and pancakes.It sounded so good but didn't taste anything like donuts to any of us and was not really well received.Sorry to give this a low rating.I followed the recipe exactly so I have no idea why it turned out so poorly.,negative

It just looked really simple and quick, and with all the great reviews I thought it would be good.

"This was just so so.All said it was good but when I asked if I should save the recipe to make again, all said no.I used sirloin tip steaks which almost turned into mush.Thank goodness I did not use cube steak.That would have been a definate mush.No one cared for the potatoes in this recipe.I did follow the recipe and did not overcook.I cooked it on high for 3 hrs instead of the reccomended 4-5 hours.This is not a saver for us.",negative

It was really bland and tasteless.,negative

It really lacked any flavor, we used fresh basil, and alot, but since there was no ammount stated,i added a bit, then a bit more, trying to get it to taste like something more than crushed tomatoes.

It was nothing like hooter's wings.,negative
"With all the great reviews I was really looking forward to this tonight.I've got to say it was without a doubt the worst meal that's ever comeout of my kitchen.. the presentation was saved by a handful of shredded cheese on top..otherwise it looked like ..never mind..when the cream cheese was stirred in, it changed the whole thing in to a pot of gray-ish, lumpy ick.I know each persons tastes are different, and I am certainly outnumbered on the opinionsthis time.. I can't even think of anything I could do to make it edible. sorry",negative
I got this recipe for my mom to make for our super bowl party. It turned out way to salty and oniony flavored. I think that if you use the dip OR the onion flakes this may take the severe saltyness away.,negative

"Very odd tasting, and not very good. I am going to try it again without the limes, I think they throw the flavor off for me. Sorry!",negative
"I selected this recipe hoping to improve its current rating. It seemed to have good possibilities. Alas, the results were not so good. First, the measurement for the baking soda is unclear -- I guessed it was 1/2 teaspoon.Next, the type of molasses was not specified, I choose regular and wished I purchased a light one.The molasses overpowered the ginger and left a strong flavor onthe tastebuds. I tried baking these five minutes, most of the cookies burned. Next, 3 minutes, noburning, but the cookies were brick hard not all crisp. I couldn't get my nephews to eat them, and they are teens who eat everything. By the third pan, I realized the best use for the dough was making a gingerbread house as we found them inedible.I keep thinking something must be missing here.So sorry about the review, really wanted to like these.

"I tried this recipe because the rating and description were appealing. I started making it and found that the instructions didn't even make sense. It doesn't say what temperature to cook the flour and half and half mixture at--just ""whisk in a saucepan""--it doesn't even really say to cook it at all.It turned out being very greasy and bland and overall gross. Very disapointing. I am fairly new to cooking, and I hope that I just read the instructions wrong and that it really isn't supposed to taste like that, but that's not likley and I'm not going to make it again and find out.",negative
"This recipe was easy to make but not very clear. It never said when to add the vanilla extract so I had to guess on that one, and when everything was done and the dough had been chilled it still was not dough-like. Also, you say to flatten the cookies with a sugared fork, how are you supposed to get the sugar to stick to the fork? And once you press on the cookies with the fork, the cookies stick to it. After baking one batch (following the recipe exactly as shown) the cookies came out flat and did not taste like most snickerdoodles I've made in the past. These were also not soft, after cooling they were hard.",negative

"I was confident that this would taste yummy by the ingredients and the review - but I have to say, I didn't care for it at all. Sorry. I followed directions exactly. It just was not all the good. It really just tasted like sweet chicken which I didn't care for. I would also mix all the other ingredients before just dumping them on the chicken.",negative
This tasted awful. I really did not like it. The basil was just to much. It didn't seem to go with the dish at all. This one is definately not on my favorites list.,negative
way too much tomato and not enough meat..I also think would be better with corn tortillas ...no member of family liked it ,negative

Really dissappointed in this recipe.Bread looked great but was dry and had very little flavor.I even added extra bananas and extract.Won't be trying this again.,negative

Very over-rated.I've had much nicer ones.Found it easier to mix in a bowl and pour into the cake tin.Also I used lemon juice instead of vinegar.Won't make this again.,negative
"Surprisingly, this was probably the most boring salad I've ever eaten.I tried adding more sugar, then some salt, then some vinegar, but nothing seemed to help.Packing leftovers for lunch today (I hate wasting food) I added some honey and OJ.We'll see if that helps any.Anyway, I definitely will not be making this again.",negative
"A teaspoon of pepper?!? Was that a typo, because this dish was far too peppery.I made it for my family and we couldn;t even eat it.We had to run out for fast food.What a waste of ingredients!I was very disappointed.",negative
made this for dinner this evening and this one just wasn't one we cared for. it had an odd taste to me and my family found it to be very bland. thanks anyways- we love many of your recipes!,negative
My apologies for giving this a negative rating.The dough was still dry after adding far more oil than stated and I eventually had to make my own dough recipe.The meat filling was not impressive.,negative
This just didn't have the favor that was hoped for.I don't know why.,negative
I thought this might have potential as camping food. I found this a bit salty for sure. Also found the 1/2 cup soup mix to 1 cup water too thin.,negative
"i'm desperate for a good and easy donut recipe because my three boys love donuts. Unfortunately i have never made a decent donut (not even close), ever.I tried this recipe and I'm sorry to say that the results were a total flop.What am I doing wrong.",negative
Served this on Easter Sunday to 6 people ~ 4 adults and 2 13 yr olds.We all hated it.Will not make again.Threw out leftovers.We all agreed that canned cream corn is better.,negative
"I am from an Italian background, and my family loves Italian food.I found this recipe and decided to try it for my mom's birthday!It was absolutely the most horrible thing I've ever cooked in my life!Everyone hated it!It taste like hamburger meat and noodles mixed together-no taste at all!I will NEVER make this again! Huge disappointment!",negative

"found this soup a bit bland, next time i make it i will add some carrot and plenty of fresh coriander",negative
"wow this is extremely and i mean unbareably SALTY! why do i need to add 1/2 a teaspoon AND 2 TABLESPOONS to the batter... this was a huge waste of chicken and if i were going to suggest anything to change this, it would be to omit that 2 tablespoons of extra salt in the batter... blech!",negative
"Well I hate to break the five star cycle but I signe d the honest review form soooo...We didn't care for this dressing. I did use exta virgin olive oil cold pressed. Could that be why??? Oh well, thanks anyhow!",negative
Much too salty for us.Thanks for sharing!,negative
Very funny....NOT.,negative
After baking for 60 minutes at 325 bread was burnt on outside and undercooked inside. Not the best recipe I have tried :(,negative
"I really hate to write reviews like this, but these hockey pucks were terrible!We made them exactly per the recipe, except for adding a cup of chopped walnuts.They didn't taste too bad, but they weren't wonderful either.We cooked them as specified, and after 25 minutes, they were golden brown, and heavy, and gooey in the middle.We cooked them for another 15 minutes, and they were darker brown, still heavy as bricks, but only slighly gooey in the center.My wife and I have discussed ways of trying to salvage this recipe, but we decided that it couldn't be done and wasn't worth the effort to try to do so.Ther are too many good recipes out there to mess with this one.",negative
This was pretty terrible---VERY dry--took it o a dinner party and a couple of people didn't finish even a small piece---very disappointing!!,negative
"easy to make, but the family wouldn't eat it :(",negative
this recipe is very bland and the crust dost come out as crispy as i like thye trick to that is plain old water though dip breast in water then flour then water again then flour again makes a crispier crust. also the spices need to be kicked up a little more salt more pepper papirica garlic onion and a dash of red pepper. ,negative
"This recipe didn't work. Maybe I did something wrong, but I ended up wasting a loaf of bread and 2 packages of cheese. I will not try this one again.",negative
"This was not good at all.We took two bites and the alcohol flavor almost knocked us over.The first part of the bite was pretty tasty, but then the aftertaste was unbearable.What a waste of some great ingredients. Especially the cheese...I hate wasting cheese! Sorry Dancer! ",negative
"I have to agree with Neely. Way to much fat, calories and carbs to be healthy.I'm sure it is very tasty and would be good on a hot summer day but I can't say it is healthy.",negative
"After following the directions for this recipe exactly, my meatloaf did not turn out. After cooking it for four hours on the instructed temp. it was still raw inside. The only thing i could think of that went wrong was that the instructions were unclear on the size bottle of ketchup and A-1. I was very dissappointed because this recipe sounded very good.",negative
"Personally I thought this was a waste of good raspberries. I love both banana bread and raspberries, but didn't feel they worked well together in this case. Also, be aware that if you use frozen berries the addition of the extra raspberry juice gives the bread an unappealing color. ",negative
"I don't understand the rave reviews.I followed the recipe instructions, which were very easy, but found the result to be bland and boring.In fact, my husband, who loves anything with mushrooms, asked me never to make it again.He won't even eat the leftovers!",negative
"I made this recipe to get rid of some excess onions and used what was around the house. I used baking soda instead of paking powder, cornflour instead of cornmeal and olive oil instead of peanut oil; I omitted the sugar as I assumed that was to cater to the american palette.The basic ingredients are onions, flour and milk anyway.The resulting product (a word of advice, the heat level needs to be quite low) didn't taste too good, was heavy and not easy to digest.I think I'll throw away the onions next time.",negative
I didn't care too much for this sauce at all. There is a much better clone forBig Mac sauce circulating on the Internet. This one didn't even come close. Sorry!,negative
"My husband thought it was a little too dry,seems like good ingredients just needs a little more moisture.",negative
"Ellie I love ya, but this just didn't quite sit right with me.I have made many types of Bread Pudding, beings it's my dad's ABSOLUTE favorite thing to eat, however, the cheese, with the scallions, and Cilantro...while it did make it a ""savory"" dish, it just didn't meld well with the other flavors for me.Wont be making this one again.",negative
it mreally bad. u should really have a different name.,negative
It was a meal.,negative
I followed the directions to the letter; 450 degrees is too hot for 1.5 hrs. Too many croutons soaked up the sauce. Taste was not the best.,negative
I have to say that the preparation was very easy but the results were extremely disappointing. There must be a step left out here because the condesned milk turns into a caramel and sticks to the bottom of the baking sheet ruining the entire batch. I tried spray and wax paper and nothing helped. The macaroons never actually get cooked all the way through and the coconut is extremely difficult to work with when it comes to making the shape. I bought the best of ingredients and was sadly disappointed with the results. Nothing this easy can ever come out good.,negative
"made this with a Betty Crocker Cherry Chip cake mix.It did not work at all, and my cake overall changed texture,moist cake but crumb was like a shortbread flake and taste.After all the good ratings, I thought this would be great, but to my dismay it was not at all good.",negative
"sorry... husband and I did not enjoy this one.the marmalade made it taste too sweet for my husband (he doesn't like sweet flavors to his food).We didn't taste a hint of teriyaki sauce, so maybe if we added more of that.The texture was odd, it almost felt as if it wasn't cooked all the way, but I cooked it even longer than the directions, and the color certainly told us it was done.Very easy to make though.",negative
Mine didn't turn out so 'melt in your mouth' like either...I have tried this recipe twice now and each time they come out super flat and the bottoms burn..I am however able to get them off the pan. Does the chef have any comments or advice on how to cook these?,negative
"Sorry, it didn't work for me. And to make matters go from bad to horrible my dog kept licking the patch off my arm and subsequently died from eating the chocolate. I loved that dog. This is the worst recipe ever and now I have to go find a good drink recipe from guess where?'Zaar!",negative
"Sorry, but I had trouble with recipe.After adding the honey, sugar etc I couldn't get the egg whites to form the very stiff peaks.It just didn't work out for me.",negative
"I'm not sure what it was, but we didn't enjoy this at all. Sauce didn't really have anything yummy in it. Sorry, it just wasn't anything special.",negative
"After reading all the great reviews I'm confused as to what happened but this did not taste very nice at all when I made it. My fiance did not like it either. We had to throw it away and make something else. Oh well, probably something I did. Sometimes ya fail sometimes ya don't.",negative
The 3 cups flour became about 7 to make it a workable dough.Must be an error in the recipe.I probably should toss it at this point (dough rising now) but I will continue with recipe and post with end results.,negative
We didn't care for the taste of this. Maybe it was because all I could taste was beer and pepper flakes. I honestly don't think I will try this again. The beer flavor was a bit too much. It did however make the meat very tender.,negative
"Maybe I was expecting these to be as tasty and spicy like traditional Indian pakoras. But these were bland and the ""bind"" was weak. Try besan (gram flour) instead of the corn flour and plain flour. Rice flour is a good trick - the pakoras were crunchy. Had to add lots of chili powder and green chiles!",negative
"There's not enough liquid in this recipe.It was just crumbs.I was able to mash together 3 balls (which were as hard as rocks after baking), but I did add 1/2 cup applesauce to the remaining batter and that solved the liquid problem.The cookies were not tasty.I won't make this again.",negative
not good,negative
"I made this quiche using a ""deep dish"" pie shell, but all the listed ingredients did not fit inside my one, deep pie shell.We really did not like it for reasons I will note; however, I think it can be drastically improved.The ratios of cheese and spinach seemed to be out of proportion to the other ingredients (cheese too thick and sinewy and dish too heavy with spinach).My husband tasted it and refused to eat any more.I love quiche, but I ended up throwing most of it away.I believe the recipe could be a real hit for us if I (a) double everything except the spinach and Muenster and make 2 quiche(s); (b) shred the Muenster cheese and spread it throughout instead of in one heavy layer; and (c) add 3/4 cup mayonnaise to reduce the density of the dish.I do love making quiche on the weekend so we can slice it up for a quick, 'cooked' breakfast on workdays.I've been making a lot of quiche lately, so maybe we've become quiche-finicky.I do not doubt others have loved the dish; I look forward to implementing my alterations to see if we can love it, too. ",negative
"DON'T DO IT!!It takes 50 min to make but 3 hrs to clean melted cheese off the pans, spoons, blender, strainer, pots, etc.The original tastes great.The ""creative adaptation"" of a bit more chipotle and chopped portabella seems... unnecessary",negative
I made this for dinner last night.I will not make it again.I found it unpleasant in its blandness.I cut the recipe in half as I cook only for myself.I did eat it with a very large helping of ketchup as I couldn't see throwing it away.I'm sure there are probably many people out there that like this type of recipe.I guess I'm not one of them.Sorry.,negative
"This was terrible.It did not even taste remotely similar.After all of that work, and ending up with an unbalanced, poor tasting seasoning, I would recommend just spending the $3 and buying the blend.When I tried to use it with a recipe from the www.mrsdash.com website, which is awesome by the way, it ended up with a meal that my family could not even eat.",negative
Well I personally did not care for this. It was too tart for my taste and for the taste of those I served it to. I guess its name suits it because it reminded me of the salad you get in the tubs at the super market.(the prior review goes to show it's all a matter of personal taste) Thanks anyhow!!,negative
"I followed the instruction perfectly...totally tasteless. Sorry, just not good at all.",negative
"This was awful...we had to throw it out and have bagels for dinner. I did make some substitutions (4 tortillas, low fat cheese and low fat soup) so maybe that's what ruined it. It tasted way too salty.",negative
"I really thought this soup was bland!I followed the directions.I ended up trying to add some bouillon cubes and other spices, I was very disappointed in the results.Sorry",negative
"Jeez, I hate giving bad ratings, with 2 DS's, my DH and myself none of us liked it, many different reasons, my reason--very greasy,lacked spices(perhaps needed chili powder and cumin) and disliked when eating it the batter popped of like in a honeycomb fashion. My DH and DS's simply disliked it due to the grease,lacking flavor and the corn kernels popped upon cooking, and yet I didn't think 325' was hot enough enough to brown only to absorb oil, I ended up raising temp. to 350' with better results, but the end product was very dissapointing to us. But than we all have different tastes, thank anyway Kaceys Momma..........",negative
I made these and their was no way I could make 36 cookies. I could only get 16 and the cookie tasted horrible.I do not recommend making these.,negative
"This bread was horrible. I love bread even when it does not turn out well but this was yucky. It was too wet, did not rise, did not have even a hint of sweetness and I did not taste very apple.A waste of apples. But my 7 year old liked it so I gave it 1 star. I",negative
"Sorry, but this recipe didn't work.I think 1 cup of water was insufficient; maybe at least 2-3 cups of water are needed.",negative
This recipe is not good. Very bad instructions. The cake was a big flop! I had to throw it out.,negative
"this recipe was not difficult to make but i used sesame oil instead of proper tahini as i couldn't find any.the problem with that was all i could smell and taste in the hummus was the sesame oil and it was awful, perhaps if i had the tahini oil it would have made a difference but isn't tahini oil sort of a sesame oil??",negative
"This was more like a crab quiche, the eggs were way to much.It totally killed the flavor of the crabmeat.I would not make this again.",negative
I have no idea what went wrong but this seemed to make a sticky dough for me. I cooked it until it was paste then mixed in the oil and some food paste. It never seemed to get less sticky even when I left it out overnight after I tried working some more flour into it. I really wish I came out with something like in the photo for recipe!,negative
"I tried this and it was not what I am used to in Potato Salad. All it is, is alot of mayonnaise and potatoes, no onion, egg, bacon nothing but potatoes, mayo, and vinegar YUCK! Sorry",negative
"i think this needed some binding agent, as it just didn't hold together well for me at all. they were unstable to start off with, and then it all came apart as i was turning them in the skillet. it also could have used some more seasoning, as the taste was rather bland. sorry for the poor review, but this didn't work for us at all.",negative
what a waste of ingredients,negative
This just did not work at all for me!!The rice was lumpy (needed a lot more milk added) and if it wasn't for the nutmeg it would have been tasteless!!I added a tin of crushed pineapple to it and it just made the pineapple taste awful.Sorry That Girl Mel but I think I have to make rice pudding the old fashioned way!!,negative
Was kinda bland for my taste. However it was easy.,negative
"These didn't turn out good at all.Lacked flavor, dry texture.I thought I did something wrong so I had my sister try the recipe and she had the same results.Sorry!",negative
We didn't care for the cobbler.I added extra fresh berries and more sugar.Just disappointing.,negative
"For years I've been making my rice pudding on the stove and have been looking for a good baked recipe (to avoid an hour of stirring).Was very disappointed.By the time the milk was like pudding, the rice lost it's shape and texture--was more like mush.And no, I did not use minute rice!!Same thing happened when I tried making it in a crock pot.May be some people like that texture, but I prefer the rice to maintain its shape.Guess I'll stick with cooking on the stove.Thanks anyway!!! ",negative
"this didn't work well for us at all. i missed the besan in this and found the batter to be very bland. i search of a more authentic recipe i called home and asked my mom, she suggested i use some ground cumin or coriander seasonings to enhance the flavor, and to definitely use chana flour. sorry for the poor review, but this definitely does not yield the authentic bhajias i was hoping for.",negative
"These tasted horrible!! It had a strong bitter taste, probably because it had too much baking powder. The texture wasn't bad though.",negative
"Sorry but no!. This whole thing is just wrong. As my husband is a creamed corn fan I thought I'd give it a try to go with a chili lunch. I can't exactly put my finger on what this is but good corn bread it isn't. It's too heavy and dense even when well baked and I guess it's the yougut that gives it an ""off"" taste. I'm from Texas folk and have been making cornbread forever. I have used buttermilk most of the time and have always had excellent results. My appologies but I have to give this one a pass",negative
"June 11, 2001: I've been making tzatziki for years and this is the best one I've ever made.May 15, 2005: Used a chinois to drain the yogurt and it worked great. Much easier than a cheesecloth. Only drained for 3 hours, but turned out great again.",positive

It didn't have much taste.,negative

"Bland,too much cheese,not enough sauce,too much sherry and I used half what therecipe called for.Would not make this again.",negative
"Unfortunately, we didn't care for this one at all.The flavors didn't blend, even after simmering for more than ten minutes on the stove.It tasted like warm milk with tomatoes floating in it.I think it needs some tomato sauce or something to give the broth more flavor.Maybe someone else will have better luck with this recipe.Thanks anyway!

"Sorry but I found this tastleless. I tried adding things ( tomato sauce, paprika, etc) for more flavour but it still lacked taste. I thought it would taste like beef stroganoff but it didn't.",negative
"Sorry, I followed the recipe, but I could not do anything with it. So dry. I baked it aways and it was like styrofoam. Is there something missing in the recipe?",negative
I don't understand how others were so pleased with this recipe.It didn't work at all on the urine smell.I tried it two different times to make sure. ,negative

"Wow!What's up with this recipe?I did exactly what the recipe states and it was burnt on top, wet in the center and the whole thing stuck, sides and bottom.I saw a few 5 star reviews and thought I couldn't go wrong.Sorry but I was very disappointed in this recipe. ",negative
"tried this and found it really bland, I think I'll stick with the regular method",negative
Easy to make but no one in my family like it.Soup mixture on top was awful.,negative
"I think that the basic recipe ingredient list is wonderful, but I would decrease the amount of butter, drain the corn and green chiles and add pimento or chopped roasted red pepper.I made this recipe exactly as given and it was floating in butter and did not get as firm as it should have.I might make it again but I'll definately change ingredient amounts to make a firmer casserole.",negative
I was so dissapointed at the flavor of this.I used a lowfat eagle brand sweet milk and found the flavor overpowering.I will try this again using a lowfat evaparated milk next time and just sweeten it myself.,negative

"It's good but not authentic so don't be fooled.I'm from Athens.A lot of the items are in our Greek salads, but we don't use mint, any lettuce, or pepperoncinis.The biggest mistake Americans make is in thinking every salad has to have lettuce in it.",negative
"Sorry, I wasn't very happy with this recipe. Maybe I did something wrong but the meat was like a hard rubber by the time it came out of the pan. I guess we are just use to rare beef. Personally I didn't find the sauce all that appealing either. Sorry, everyone has different taste I guess. ",negative
Not a big hit with us either. The sauce did not have much flavor for my pork chops. It was worth a shot though!,negative

"I picked blueberries for 2 hours, cleaned stems for another hour. Thought the recipe was different from any other canning I'd done due to very short cooking time and very long processing time but I went with it. The syrup was VERY thin and runny, the recipe neglected to inform of amount of air/fill space to leave at the top so I had to guess. Thus almost none of the jars sealed properly.

Horrible! Absolutely horrible! How can you have all that juice with no binder? Bread crumbs? Burgers just fell to pieces and tasted terrible! Do the chefs actually cook these meals first?!,negative
I did not deviate from the recipe or instructions. Did not care for this.Seemed to be too much spinach and no flavor. ,negative
"I followed this recipe exactly so i don't know what went wrong. But it tasted burnt, runny. Had a texture that i really didn't care for. Looked anything but good. After about 15 minutes in the oven it started to burn. Not sure what the problem was, but we didn't care for it.:(",negative
"Flavor good, texture AWFUL. Needs baking powder?",negative

I tried this because it was different and I love broccoli. But I have to say its a bit to different. It was quite the mess. Sorry.,negative
this was hard to make. it tasted dull with no flavor at all. when boiling in the baking soda water it left a baking soda taste on the pretzels. I'm not going to make this again ,negative
this recipe wasn't appealing to me.it was super easy to make but i didn't like the taste,negative
"This recipe tries too hard to be ""healthy"". Bread pudding should be made from white or brown bread, and quite a lot of (whole) milk is needed to make a generous custard. Egg whites are out of place here: only whole eggs will do. The bread should not be toasted -- I can't see the reason why, as the end result should be tender and custardy on the inside and crusty on top. This is not a recipe I would try: no ways can 1/2 cup milk work, neither can 2 egg whites or wholewheat bread. The ingredients are skew, somehow. ",negative
I thought this recipe sounded so good but we were VERY disappointed. I will not be making it again!,negative
Sorry .. I may have done something wrong but I believe I made it just as it is here but the thyme was just too overpowering for us. Good texture but i wonder if that should have been teasons and not tablespoons. I will try that next time.,negative
Nothing like JCS. They didn't stick together very well. But I did use the calculator to make the recipe smaller,negative

"I hate to leave such a low review, especially since there are so many good ones but this wine did not turn out well at all!I followed your directions exactly and even went over them several times to make sure I was doing it correctly.We picked two baskets of Mustang grapes and made 2 1/2 gallons of wine in a huge crock.We bottled the wine to give as gifts and 6 bottles exploded sending wine all over my kitchen.Lets just say I was not happy at all to be cleaning up sticky red wine off the ceiling, floor, wallpaper, table, chairs, and dog - six different times!!!We finally decided to take them outside and open them up and dump them as we knew the others would eventually explode as well.The wine smelt like wine and tasted more like grape juice before being bottled.However, after a week of being bottled the wine did not taste like wine nor grape juice.It had a very acidic, fizzy taste to it and seemed to be more bubbles than wine when poured into a glass.I definitely will try a different method for wine next time around.

Sauce was excellent but the meatballs were as others said, bland (despite the fact that I added extra seasoning) and very moist (borderline mush)We each started with 1 meatball.Only my 17 year old son ate the whole meatball but did not want a 2nd.We gave the scraps to the dog along with another meatball.Even the dog walked away from his bowl.

"I did not care for this recipe at all.I ended up with brownies with a thick crunchy crust on top, and raw batter underneath.I don't usually have problems with uneven cooking in my oven, so I have to attribute it to the recipe.Plus, the brownies that were cooked more around the edges of the pan tasted more like a dense chocolate cake than the chewy fudgy brownies that I prefer.Definitely not a keeper for me.",negative
"I put these in the oven and checked on them a couple minutes later, and there was just one big puddle of bubbling cheese.Very hard to get off the cookie sheet.It was just like a piece of fried cheese.",negative
"We didn't care for this at all.Way too much herbs.Also, the sauce wouldn't thicken up when I was cooking it so I had to add more cornstarch.",negative
I'm sorry to say this wasn't worth the slight effort.I had to double the sugar as it was much too sour from the unrinsed sauerkraut and the oil made it kind of slimy.I threw it out.,negative
"There must be a mistake in the instructions, as the dough is NOT ""pourable"", it's stiff, and you end up with 5 tough snakes instead of 50 tender cookies.",negative
"I enjoy thai peanut sauce, this one however did not live up to my expectations. I was extremely disappointed in the finished product. The flavor was too much of too much and so greasy. ",negative
I must be the weird one because I thought these spices together were not very pleasant. The odor filled the house for a few days. Oh well.,negative
"I followed the recipe as written, but we did not enjoy this meal. The chicken was very bland. The potatoes were the best part of the meal. With the wonderful aroma that filled the house all day long, we expected a fantastic dinner. I would not make this again. ",negative
"These cookies totally disappointed me!The batter was greasy, which was my first clue that something was off, and after baking they ended up very flat and crispy.They still taste like good peanut butter cookies, but not at all the texture I was hoping for.",negative
"very easy to make,but I'm sorry to say it was one of the worst chicken recipes I've tried. we found it to be very plain..I kept thinking,whats the big deal?",negative
"You have forgotten many ingredients, plus you must drain the yogurt using a coffee filter and and small plastic container(from margarine) placed into a larger plastic container(2 lbs.) that you have saved from frozen fruit, etc.That way you can drain your yogurt in the frige, and the resulting cheese will last much longer.Some things to add, after draining your yogurt for a day or two is undrained cucumber,(you have drained the whey off the yogurt, why waste the cucumber flavor?) dried dill, mint, salt, garlic powder, pepper, lemon juice, and anything else from your spice rack.This is really a matter of knowing what you are doing to begin with.",negative
"One mix, OK, we all feel the time squeeze---but 3 mixes/instant ingredients YUK!And cool whip is so awful---takes less than 2 minutes to whip real cream in the ol' Kitchen Aid.Rather than use a cake mix, use store-bought angelfood cake, torn in small pieces and toasted, if you like.I just think that if you're going to have dessert, HAVE dessert!Same calories, better taste.",negative
"I followed the recipe just as it was written, but my finished product came out runny and it just didn't taste quite right.It's a good idea, just an imbalance of ingredients.",negative
This didn't work for me. So sorry! The cookie crust was so hard because of the almonds I guess after I refridgerated it. ,negative
"This was the worst substance I've ever tried in my life! I made it to use in a batch of frosting and when I tasted it, I almost gagged. It's starchy and bitter, not sweet at all. Maybe it works in certain types of recipes, but never try it in frosting. YUCK!",negative
i decided not to use as much seasoning as suggested because we have a three year old in the house and i felt it might be a little much for her. Even with the decreased amount this recipe turned out to be very salty and we will not be serving this at any barbecues any time soon.,negative
I found this recipe to be very bland.,negative
"Did I do something wrong with this recipe? None of my family liked it, and I couldn't even finish mine. Sorry. Wish I had a better review. I have never had Kalamata olives before and did not care for them. I thought there was too much parmesean cheese making it way too salty and I didn't even add the extra salt. Oh well. Maybe the way you make it comes out way better. Mine wasn't even pretty.",negative
I didn't really like this parfait. My kids didn't like it either and they usually have a totally different taste in foods than i do. I will suggest that you do not waste your time making this particualer parfait. I know i will not be making it again,negative

"I made these last night for a snack for my co-workers, and I am not sure what I did wrong but they were VERY dry and had very little flavor. It was very disapointing because they looked so wonderful, they were a great color and rounded up out of the muffin cups perfectly. I wonder if I used white flour and no whole wheat flour if they would improve? On a positive note however, they were good for my 1 year old, not to sweet and a good texture which made little to no mess when he ate it.I am going to try these again and only use white and leave out the wheat and see if that works out because peanut butter and banana are 2 of my favorites.",negative
"I was so disapointed in this recipe.The bread was dry and of course it was... especially when it only called for 2Tbl of butter..... Also, I think the dates should be chopped and the recipe doesn't tell you that.I really depend on other reviews to decide if i try something so i was very sad to see that others gave this 5 stars when honestly... it didn't deserve any.I won't be keeping this recipe.I think i'll forge ahead and try a recipe for some date nut bars since i have extra dates...Sorry!!!",negative
This was the worst thing i have ever tasted. It is definately not what they serve in the mexican restaurants.,negative
"I picked this because it looked really easy.I don't know what I did with this one because it came out like... well, let's just say we could have played football with the loaf!I'm new at the homemade poundcake thing, though,and this was my first try.",negative
"Whatever this is, it isn't Hungarian.",negative
Way too salty! What a way to ruin a nice piece of fish. Followed the recipe as stated except used the BBQ to cook. ,negative
"I did not like it. It is not even close to a real basboosa, it was not even slightly fluffy. My advise is to use 2 cups plain yoghurt, but not milk, then basboosa is not hard. And do not use this huge amount of lemon juice, 1-2 teaspoons are enough.",negative
With over 2000 mg of sodium a person eating this is practically committingsuicide! NO THANKS!,negative
Very Disappointing!,negative
Hmmmm ... I've seen this recipe in a few places and it is reviewed highly.I must have purchased the wrong kind of beef ribs because the ribs I made were rubbery and tasteless in spite of the intense marinade. I'll give this recipe another whirl (because of its good reputation) but next time I'll marinate the ribs for longer and perhaps even extend the cooking time.,negative
ABSOLUTELY AWFUL!!!! I followed the recipe to the letter and it came out so salty I had to throw the entire thing away! It wasn't even edible. I cooked it for my boyfriend's b-day and we ended up eating a frozen pizza while $50 worth of prime rib sat in the trash. :(,negative
"Sorry, but this tasted more like beef stroganoff than lasagna.",negative
I guess I will be the lone reviewer that did not care for this dish.I used Romano cheese instead of the Parm and I do not know if that made a major difference. I felt that the white sauce should of had some more flavor..I added extra garlic and salt but it still tasted like it was missing something. Maybe some of the cheese I should of put into the sauce to give that more of a flavor boost.Sorry I would not probably go the extra route to make this again. But the list of ingredients sure sounded good. ,negative
"If I could give this recipe a ""0"" star I would. This muck is an absolute horrible waste of chicken meat. The chicken was dry, and a horrible color, and the sauce that should be ""thick and bubbly"" in the last step will NOT get this way in che crock pot. The house even smelled like a spoiled creamsicle mixed with an pungant spice that I could not quite put my finger on. Horrible is much too kind of a word for this recipe.",negative
Well.. That´s not burek.. That´s pita.. And there are better fillings..,negative
"This didn't turn out to our taste. I understand it is a fish stew but it was still overly fishy. I think it needs some other seasoning to mellow it. Some of the seafood was overcooked, you should not add it all together. We didn't eat all of this.",negative
Easy to make.We all didn't like this.Something was very overpowering. ,negative

"It was very dry and didnt come close to tasting like White bread! I even added butter but no it still didnt tast very well, sorry! ",negative
i really didnt see a difference,negative
I am going to try this s breakfast casserole one more time using white bread rather than wheat.I am sorry to report that it was not very tasty.,negative
"I don't know... these turned out like little rubber disks for me.I think they do not have anywhere near enough leavening and I think the amount of acid (vinegar) that is added needs to be higher.I didn't really like the flavor either.I think they need some oil too- most pancakes I have made in the past that are fat free also use beaten egg whites, which these don't.I think they need a Tbs or two at least.I also found that i only could use 2 cups of milk and it was already too thin.I am wondering if there aren't some omissions in this recipe.I eventually ended up salvaging them, but had to add a lot of additional ingredients and they still weren't very good.The ones I made per the recipe hit the trash can.Sorry.",negative
I guess that is how they cook in the restaurants I would not try it...sorry,negative
"Sorry, I didn't the ginger went with this at all.Perhaps I got too much ginger in there or something.",negative
"I wanted to use up some carrots and this sounded interesting, but in the end result I don't think it worked. Maybe mayo with carrots will be a better combination for someone else.",negative

I want a recipe for a creamy dressing for a cold cucumber salad - not a recipe for any other kind of salad,negative

"what a waste of time and effort.Roasting tends to dry the corn, soaking didn't help.",negative
I was burned by popping cornmeal after following the directions.Recipe needs to be revised. Cannot possibly follow directions as written. Also the ratio of water to cornmeal seems off. I could not finish the recipe so I cannot review on taste.,negative
I made this dessert for company and I was so disappointed . The dessert texture was very strange and hard. I guess I was expecting a more smooth texture. ,negative

"this dark rye and whole wheat bread would be a great recipe, however, you can not use any sugar substitutes in any bread recipes, so I added regular sugar in place of the sugar sub.",negative
"My family and I found this way to sweet in fact we couldn't finish it. Ugggg also the Brown sugar never melted it just caught fire, thank goodness I was watching it. You would have to have an incredible sweet tooth for this one. ",negative
"I was uncomfortable with the low cooking temperature and went to http://www.fsis.usda.gov just to make sure it was safe. There is a pull down at the top of the page “fact sheets” that says the safe temperature for chicken is 350!! I called the toll free number (888-MP hotline) and was told that it is very unsafe to cook chicken or turkey this way, because it gives bacteria time to multiply while it is reaching the safe internal temp of 180. I went ahead and cooked the chicken at the safe temperature of 350 and it was wonderful, but I am concerned about someone getting sick.",negative
This did not go over well in my family.I thought the barbecue sauce overwhelmed and the other flavors were out of balance.The burgers also fell apart during frying.,negative

I also tried the ground turkey and didn't care for the end result either.,negative
"I tried this recipe...the dough was too runny, added about 1 Cup more flour and still the dough did not form a ball. The bread turned out to be completely inedible. Did I do something wrong. I used 3 bananas for the recipe.",negative
"I tried this and it really didn't do anything for me. I used Greek yoghurt which I love, but I think the peanut butter changed the texture for me. I won't make it again. I already make a similar breakfast without the nuts so I will just continue to do that. ",negative
"Tried to add peanut butter chips and they would not go into dough batter!!!As well, just as greasy as other PB recipes - think more flour is needed!Finally VERY hard to mix batter - almost burned out mixer, and by hand you need to be very strong to turn batter (ended up using hands)!Leaving batter sit for an hour did very little to help with problem.",negative
We did not care for this. I halved the recipe since there was only 3 of us. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and used 1 1/2 c. crushed can tomatoes. It still came out a little dry after the baking. We didn't think that it had much flavor.,negative
I made the recipe exactly as is but almost the entire dish remained untouched. This in spite of the fact that our family is very fond of sweet-mustard sauces. It is probably an individual taste thing - either you like it or you don't. We didn't but some will.,negative
"I'm sorry, I followed your recipe and our pork chops were already overcooked within 40 minutes.The liquid didn't boil down, so our chops really didn't have much flavour as the sauce didn't penetrate or coat them. I won't be making this again. ",negative
"Sorry. I followed the recipe as written except we grilled them outside. Was very easy, but we didn't care for the marinade. Maybe it needed some rice vinegar and sesame oil??",negative
"I can't believe all these rave reviews.I have never had such bad indigestion in my life - I was up half the night after I made this.In my opinion, the garlic and orgegano overwhelmed the dish - that was all we could taste.That with the garlicy cucumber yoghurt sauce and sliced onions were just too much.If I had to go to work the next day, I would have offended the whole office.It also bore no resemblance to Gyros I've had elsewhere. Sorry (and sorry for me).",negative

I have just finished baking this cake.

"Followed this exactly but it just didn't work. Some didn't even hold up. It wasn't quite inedible but these are not what truffles are to me. I thought they were easy to make, but I guess that was too good to be true. I will try another recipe, thanks anyway.",negative
"This recipe had a wonderful flavor, however it was compacted like a fruit cake, a bit soggy, and only raised two or inches tall. I know I got as much liquid as possible out with a sieve. All my ingredients were fresh. I had to bake it an hour instead of 45 minutes, and it still was soggy inside. I have baked zucchini bread for many years, and eaten a lot of other people's too, but I have never encountered anything like this.",negative

I made this dish awhile ago and forgot to write a review. I was so excited to make this recipe. And I was horribly disappointed!!!!!!!My family who usually eats everything took a few bites and wouldn't eat the rest. I followed the recipe exactly. It just wasn't for any of us.,negative

"This recipe has way too much flour in it. Whoever says you can dissolve 3/4c of flour in 1c of water is crazy. That makes dough. It is impossible to get the flour dissolved and when you do, you can't taste the soup over the flour. Gross. Maybe it would work better with a few Tbsp of cornstarch instead. I will have to experiment.",negative
Not at all the white cheese that I have had at authentic mexican restaurants.Very disappointed.,negative
These cookies were so hard my babies got frustrated trying to gnaw off a bite.They ended up throwing them on the floor and crying.These would probably be good for a teething biscuit but that isn't what I was looking for.,negative
I don't know what went wrong but mine ended up so hard you couldn't even bite into them.No one would touch them and I ended up throwing the whole pan out.Not to mention the chocolate chip covered cheerios are incredibly messy in sweaty little hands.I didn't find them to be kid-friendly at all.,negative
"Couldn't get this recipe to work for me at all.The dough tasted good when raw but, once in the oven, fell flatter than a pancake and was extremely difficult to remove from the pan.I don't know if I messed up or if there's a typo in the recipe somewhere.I'm interested to read other reviews...",negative

"I was excited to try this recipe after all the positive reviews, but the flavors turned out processed and artificial instead of like the home-baked comfort food I had hoped it would be. It tastes like if you dunked an onion-flavored donut into cheese sauce. I didn't think the cream of chicken soup and cheese base tasted good with the sweetness of the Pillsbury crescent rolls, and the chicken/onion/cream cheese filling was a little strong.I felt heavy and unhealthy after eating this.It does bake up beautifully, however, just like the photos!My husband said it was good, though!",negative

In the mean time I do not recommend you try this one!",negative
"I am certainly out numbered here.With all the great reviews I surely thought this would be a hit with the family.NOT!I liked the bean and corn mixture, but I think using frozen chicken breasts let off a lot of extra water and made the sauce very runny.The color of the saucewas not very appetizing - sort of pink with chunks of white from the cream cheese or maybe chicken scum from using frozen chicken. Not a repeat for my family.",negative
"This recipe calls for way too much garlic.The garlic totally overwhelmed the clams to the point where they were inedible.I will probably try this again, but will definately make adjustments on the amount of garlic used.",negative
"I'm afraid this turned out terrible.I followed the recipe exactly, but it was very bland.The meat was all crumbly and peppers turned to mush.The sauce was very thin and we couldn't even use it on our rice.It was a very disapppointing meal.",negative
"Sorry, Fluffy, but I made this last night and it was more like a soup then a casserole.I even uncovered this for the last 1/2 hour in order to get rid of some of the liquid but I still had to thicken it with a bit of flour and water.I followed the recipe exactly but just didn't like the consistency as I wanted a 1 meal dish....not a soup.",negative
This was a terrible mix. Might as well taken shots. Next time I'll definately use the traditional mix.,negative
"As I kept kneading and kneading and adding heaps upon heaps of flour to turn this into a workable dough, I was wishing I could give this zero stars, as it doesn't deserve even one, especially for the large volume of ingredients I lost:( I used yogurt and there's no way on earth that 3.5 cups flour is enough for this as it was sticky as anything.

"Sorry, I didn't care for the flavor of this soup. Way too ""tomato-y"". I wonder if I was supposed to use a smaller can of tomato? I used 2 28oz cans of diced tomato. Instead of ham, I put a ham bone in for flavor and cooked over 6 hours on low, but lentils and veggies still very firm. Not sure if it's my crockpot or not. I have now turned it to high and will leave it on high for 2 hours. ",negative
"I think the deep frying ruins this. I was reluctant but went ahead anyway, and all the grease and extra calories is just not worth the taste in the end. It was also very bland with just the overpowering taste of yoghurt, perhaps some cumin or coriander powder would have picked up the flavour? I would suggest these changes along with omitting the deep frying. Sorry for the low review but my family could just not finish this one.",negative
"I thought this recipe had way too much soy sauce.I kept adding peanut butter so the soy sauce wouldn't be so overwhelming, but I ran out of peanut butter.I wouldd reccomend adding a little soy sauce at a time untill you like the taste so you don't waste a bunch of peanut butter.",negative

"My husband loves boiled peanuts! This recipe is similar to one I use regularly.However, for our tastes, the cooking time and water content is way off.The longer you simmer the better so the peanuts have a chance to soak up the flavor the of brine and soften. Usually, depending on the peanuts, I will let them simmer about 10 hours, then turn them off and allow to sit in the brine for another 3 hours or so. As for the water,use enough to cover the peanuts and then some. I always make plenty to have on hand and keep some also in the freezer. Boiled peanuts are definitely an acquired taste. We do love them!",neutral

The third time it was perfect.When I followed the directions, I was amazed at HOW MUCH I was making. It filled the Bundt nearly at least 3/4 full, but I steadfastly followed the directions.It was ALL OVER my oven, and still inedible.

Have you tried this dish??,negative
"Oh my.We had high hopes for this, based on the former reviews, but there were just too many tastes going on.Lemon, cloves (waaay too much), pumpkin, and chocolate just didn't end up jelling at all.The top burned while the batter remained still raw in the middle.I didn't dare try to continue to cook it further.Based on the ""amazing"" review, again, I had high hopes, but again, they just didn't pan out.",negative
Sorry but this was just way too sweet for our taste.,negative
"This recipe doesn't make a batter, like it suggest, there wasn't enough liquid in it to get the flour mixed together. The rolls turned out crumbley and tasteless. ",negative
"I'm sorry, but this was just horrible!! Maybe because I altered it a bit to what I had on hand. I followed everything except I used bacon, mushrooms and onions instead of the chicken and omitted the chili pepper. It was very rubbery on the bottom and just tasted gross. I ended up throwing the whole thing away.",negative
"I was very disappointed with this recipe. Reading all of the other reviews I guess my expectations were too high, but I followed the recipe to a T and ended up with something that looked more like meatloaf soup! I used a loaf pan which I wouldn't recommend. It was VERY greasy and fell apart before I could even get it out of the pan.

Maybe it's just a matter of taste, but I found this dish to be very bland and, as another reviewer noted, a bit dry. I considered just tossing it out, but I hate to waste things, so I sprinkled it liberally with garlic powder and added some salt and pepper and a pinch or two each of cayenne pepper and paprika. I also added a tiny bit more olive oil to moisten it up a bit. This livened it up enough for us to go ahead and have it for dinner, but I won't be making this recipe again.",negative
I didn't care for this recipe. It took forever for the dough to come together and it made a big mess.,negative
"When I tried this it curdled horribly, then was grainy after I passed it through a sieve to remove the lumps.It was nice and tangy but I couldn't bear to eat it because of the texture.",negative
"I'm sorry, this tea just did not agree with my tastebuds.It did smell really good when I was boiling it, but when it came to drinking it, I couldn't even finish the cup.Ginger and turmeric may be healthy for you, but I'll consume them in some other way.Sorry.",negative
"I have only once given a recipe one star before. I printed the recipe without the reviews (my mistake). I made it as follows and the dough went over the sides in my breadmachine. What a mess. My husband and father-in-law had to tear it totally apart to get it cleaned.When comparing this recipe to my other breadmachine recipes, I noticed it uses way to much yeast. Most bread recipes calls for 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 teaspoon for 2 pound loaf. I will try this recipe again but will not walk away from my machine.",negative
This is definitely NOT the best Marinara sauce I've ever made.it was better than a jar of Ragu or store bought but not by much.Sorry - it needs many more ingredients and better instructions,negative
"This recipe must be a joke!!!It was the worst chili recipe we had ever tasted.Cinnamon, allspice, cloves and cocoa do not belong in chili.If it was a joke, it was not funny!",negative
"Our toddler has egg allergy, so I was happy to find this egg free recipe. Sadly, without a doubt, this is the worst pancake recipe I have ever tried. With 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 cups of water, the watery mix sticks and burns at any temperature. I tasted the gooey scrapings just to find out that the whole tablespoon of baking soda and vinegar made this goo foul and inedible. I was upset by the clean-up and the waste.",negative
The sauces were good respectively but didn't work as a whole.The dish went in two directions that did not mesh. We'll definitely not be making this again. ,negative
"Sorry but I have to disagree with the previous reviews. I found this to be a beautiful looking loaf/cake, but it was bland. I followed the recipe exactly, except I coated my cherries in the flour mixture. It was dense but not that moist dense that is so desirable in a loaf; it was instead floury almost like I imagine school paste tastes. I bake everyday and have never made anything near this disappointing.",negative
"i agree it was toooooo salty. i mean almost anything would taste better. Also, if you ever decide to make this dish be near a bathroom because it will be like a ton of bricks ",negative
"I don't know if I did it wrong, but this didn't turn out like I expected. The bread cube mixture was sparce and wouldn't ""spread"" in the bottom of the pan, nor was there enough to ""spread"" on the top. It turned out burnt around the edges and with very little ""betty"" as compared to apples. I may try this one again and re-rate/review, but for now I didn't like it.",negative
"I am very sorry but this recipe turned out inedible for me. The only change I made was to the amount of beer. Since a bottle is 12 oz. I had to open a second bottle to get the full 16. The liquid didn't come close to covering the meat and veggies though so I poured in the rest of the beer and added some water until it did. As it cooked, it started to give off a bitter, rancid smell. When I sampled it, the taste was also very bitter and it left a pretty bad aftertaste. The only thing I can think of is if maybe the oregano is supposed to be fresh not dried. Other than that, I'm not sure what could have made it so bitter. Unfortunately, I am now working on coming up with something else for supper. I'm sorry.",negative
They didn't fry completely in the middle and had a rubber like texture after they cooled,negative
"This was an easy recipe, if it would have worked. the oil and cranberry mix was still separated after cooling. never actually set. ",negative
I made this and it fell apart,negative
"I do enjoy tofu, so it wasn't the tofu that ruined this for me. The only thing I can guess, is that maybe the honey gave this such an odd taste. It might have tasted better if sugar was used instead of the honey. I'm just not sure, though. The texture came out okay--a little custard-like, but held together better than I expected. I'm really not sure what it was, but this recipe just didn't work for me. After tasting it, I ended up throwing the entire cheesecake away. No one in my family would eat it either.",negative
"I would have to say that this has a good tast to it, but over all, it was not what I considered apple crisp.The crisp part of this recipe was not a bit crispy, it was all stuck together like GLUE.My husband begged me not to make it again.It did make my house smell nice, but too bad I had to throw it out, AS IT WAS ALL STUCK TOGETHER.WOULD NOT MAKE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!",negative
I made this bread tonight and it was a total flop~dense bread heavy and was way too salty~waste of my ingredients and time. very disapointed,negative
"Easy to make, but the salad dressing was very strong and over powering.Found the consistency to be rather runny as well.May be good for some, but not those looking for a traditional hummous taste.",negative
I'm so sorry but no one in my family liked the funky chicken (didn't make the noodles).It's probably personal preference but the exceptionally sweet flavor just wasn't for us and we couldn't finish.But I thank you for giving me the opportunity to try something new and discover that other recipes with this type of flavor combination won't be to our liking.,negative
"I don't know how the others did this recipe, but I followed the directions exactly and these were terrible! They were dry and crumbly, needed something more.",negative
"Very, very bad.This is probably because of the large amount of sugar.",negative
"This was easy to make, but I thought it was an odd mix of ingredients.It has the stew basics, but is covered with pretty much pasta sauce.Very weird combination, it was very hard to eat.",negative
"We ate this recipe, but that was it. Actually, I didn't even want to finish it. We threw the leftovers away. It is terribly bland. I won't make it again.",negative
"My family was NOT impressed at all by this recipe.I put in the ingredients as called for, way to much cream cheese mixture for our taste.",negative
"I can see I'm in the minority here, but I thought this was one of the blandest, tasteless recipes I'd ever tried.Unless I'd seriously overhaul it, I wouldn't try it again.",negative
"I'm sorry but I didn't like these at all.I think it must have been the cinnamon...maybe other things too.I have no idea, but I was hoping to have some great beans like they have at the rainforest cafe, just really basic.These were not to my taste at all.Sorry:(",negative
"from the other reviews I thought it would be great, but it really isn't a regular ""salisbury steak"" recipe... too tomatoey and worc. saucey tasting for us.",negative
"When the casserole was done, I took it out of the oven, tasted it, apologized to my family and ordered pizza.It was easy to make but it was inedible.The combo of gravy, tomato soup and mushroom soup was sweet and awful.",negative
"I didn't care for these.I used Kaluha, and the taste wasn't good.Sorry for the bad review, I think a different liqour might be better - maybe creme de cocoa.",negative
"This is a big mistake.Smelled great, tasted lousey.Very mushy.Don't bother.",negative
"I am sorry.This was not enough instructions for me.I didn't know the expected consistency of the batter so I kept adding ingredients (some more eggs and then went to adding milk).Still didn't get it right.I am sure it may be good but I need more specific instructions like the amount of potatoes (like in approx cups), and batter consistency expected.Thank you for submitting anyway.",negative
It's....lettuce,negative
"I found the toast to be very dry.Maybe if you cut down on the flour portion, and poke holes in the bread when dipping into the batter, it might not be so dry tasting.",negative
"This is a much runnier drink than I think egg nog should be. The thick custardy style is what I like best about egg nog generally, but this drink is kind of watery by comparison. It has a slightly sour taste from the yogurt, I believe, and the spices make it gritty. All in all, it has an uncooked taste: watery, gritty, and slightly sour.",negative
"All my guests had to say about this casserole was...Well it's filling. We all thought it was to bland, but we live in Louisiana and like things spicy.",negative
Wow I don't know what I did wrong. The mango turned out mushy and tasteless. It was just bland; the chicken (I used thighs) didn't absorb any of the flavor. ,negative
"I did not like this at all.I followed the directions exactly and I think I just don't like a ""burnt"" taste.My husband thought it tasted like burnt marshmallows....this recipe is not for us!",negative
"This one was not for us! It smelled so bad that we ordered take-away instead. Too many spices for a nice combination. Think it was the onion, garlic and white pepper that over-powered.",negative
"Gosh, I was floored that my biscuits turned out as terrible as they did...everyone rated this recipe so highly!I followed the recipe exactly as listed...was NOT impressed with this recipe - SORRY.Very bland!",negative
Too much cheese and too watery for me.Next time I will use just cream of mushroom or cream of broccoli and use grated cheddar instead of velveeta.,negative
"I did not like this recipe.It was easy to make, and I believe the meat would have been better mixed with some pasta or other vegetable, as opposed to on its own.",negative
Sorry but the sause was too thin and did not stick to the ribs. Meat was not fall off the bone either. ,negative
The rice turned to mush and the chicken tasted like glue.,negative
"I must have done something wrong.My tortills completely disintegrated and I was left with a bunch of mush that I threw out.If you make this, I don't recommend preparing it the night before you cook it.",negative
"You should NEVER feed a dog raisins, grapes or onions!Ask your vet if you don't believe me.These foods can be toxic to dogs, just like chocolate can.PLEASE, FOR THE SAKE OF YOUR DOG, LEAVE OUT THE RAISINS!!!",negative
I agree with Sausage on this cake.It was very salty tasting and I won't be making it again.Someone told me that Dutch chocolate will help prevent this... I used unsalted butter and figured I was o.k. but that was not so.,negative
Tasted like tomato soup.Maybe some tomato paste instead?,negative
"Much too dry a mix, muffins should be soft and moist.",negative
"Sorry, but we didn't care for this one. I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce just didn't have the expected flavor for the sweet and sour that we were hoping for.:(",negative
Well... I tried it but i wasn't impressed with the outcome.I followed the recipe as you stated and in the end i thought the butter was greasy on the nuts and i didn't think the coating was very flavorful.. i think it was missing vanilla.Sorry Kittencal.... i wanted to love it but couldn't.It won't stop me from trying some of your other recipes.... ,negative
"2.5 oz burgers, 2 tomato slices and 1 slice of onion for 4-6 burgers. Knead HB meat thoroughly. This has to be someone's idea of a joke or perhaps a FEMA project. Oh, and not to mention 2 lettuce leaves for 4-6 burgers.",negative
This recipe is allright but not even close to Portillo's Italian Beef.But is still tasty.I would prefer the thin sliced meat as opposed to this shredded recipe.The italian salad dressing part was confusing as they do not make that size package.I don't believe Portillo'sbeef can be copied. But don't stop trying !,neutral
"This was not good.Even DH didn't like it, and he loves meat.It was way too salty, and I only used a bit of the onion soup mix.I would make it next time with fresh chopped green peppers and onion.Then it would taste better.It's a good idea, just forget about the onion soup mix and go fresh. ",negative
"I subbed applesauce for the Smucker's product, and used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white. The resulting product was slightly rubbery, but did have a nutty, whole grain taste from the flaxmeal. But I was expecting a different texture for granola bars. These turned out so dense and heavy, my husband didn't want it. I have been breaking it up and eating it like a bowl of oatmeal, with milk.",negative
"this did'nt have much flavor, it needed something to spice it up.very bland.",negative
"Made your burger again, this time I served it on crispy toasted sourdough bread with a salad along side, enjoyed as much as the first time.15 June 0Nice subtle flavor from the lemon and worcestershire sauce. I Loved it. I scaled the recipe back to one pattie, used 1 clove garlic,4 large muchrooms, 1/2 medium onion,1/2 tsp worcestershire sauce and 1/4 tsp lemon. It was just right for my taste Thanks — Sep 16, 2001, ",positive
Added garlic salt to the recipe but found it rather tasteless.Would not use this recipe again.Glendap,negative
I made this a second time and used it on Lamb for kebobs - excellent- Let the mamb marinaste for 4 hour in the fridge Then skewered the lamb and BBQ'd for 12 minutes. I have posted pics of the lamb but should have taken one of the marinade too sorryFirst timeA taste treat!I let it rest in the fridge overnight and then for 2 hours at room temperature.ThanksBergy,positive
"This is the BEST salsa recipe ever.I added more tomato sauce because we like a smoother, thicker salsa.The flavors blend nicely.My kids can hardly wait for it to be done!I'm thinking about trying to can some in the winter...using canned tomatoes (chopped in food processor).Has anyone tried this yet?Thanks",positive
"After 1 1/2 hours my bread was STILL raw in the middle but very dark brown on the outside. And I have never had problems with my oven before. Sounded like a good recipe, which is why I gave it 3 stars, but I couldnt get it to finish cooking.",neutral
"This was far too bland for me.I don't even want to try fiddling with it to make it more to my liking.I threw half of it away, though adding some garlic powder to the leftovers I did eat helped some...",negative
"This was very tender when still hot in the pan with the ""mopping"" sauce.I poured it off and served it with the ""barbecue"" sauce.I thought both sauces were too vinegary--so I tossed them and used a barbecue sauce from the market. If I made it again, I would cut down on the vinegar in both sauces.",neutral
"If I made it again, I would still increase the proportion of egg a bit as I felt the egg mixture was a bit thin.",neutral
