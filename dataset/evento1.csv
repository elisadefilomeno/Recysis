negative,"I don't know exactly what happened, but this came out really dry and dense for me."
negative,"This was terrible. We are NOT picky eaters and love almost everything, but this was not like any jambalaya we've ever eaten. I cooked according to directions except I was out of tomato paste, but I know that didn't alter the taste that much. The chicken was dry and the shrimp was flavorless. I think if the shrimp had been marinated in a cajun seasoning while the jambalaya was cooking, that might have solved that.Because I spent so much money on the chicken and the shrimp, I tried to doctor this up as best as I could so that all my money was not wasted. I ended up sauteeing some sausage and onions, topped with cajun seasoning, and mixed it in with the rice and jambalaya. We finished as much of it as we could, but will never use this crock pot recipe again."
negative,"Tastes like plain walnuts in a cookie. BLAND. I'm going to try to make them again and triple the amount of cocoa and sweetener. Otherwise, just bland and not very good. However, dipped in sugar free carb free caramel or marshmallow....."
negative,I fallowed the directions to a tee.. and I just did not like it. It was to bland for me.
negative,"I shredded my potatoes as others indicated, but was very disappointed in the results.The potatoes had very little flavor and stuck to the baking pan."
negative,"I just made this pie for Easter and am really disappointed.I followed the instructions EXACTLY. The inside of the pie was like runny pudding.I don't know what happened, but it was kind of embarassing when I cut into it with a room full of guests.The chocolate just oozed out everywhere. I won't be making this pie again."
negative,"This recipe did not come close to meeting my expectations. The pecan crust was much too oily and clumped together. I would imagine that baking it would have fair a little better than pan frying, but I'm not sure that I'm willing to try this recipe again to see."
negative,Way too much salt!!!
negative,"This stuff is fun, but borax is toxic (as little as a spoonful can be lethal to a small child or pet) so please be careful using this with children!!!!!See the MSDS on boric acid (which borax converts to in the body) here: http://www.jtbaker.com/msds/englishhtml/b3696.htm.20 Mule Team's MSDS is here (PDF form): http://www2.prosarcorp.com/msds_frame.asp?site_id=196andmsds_id=685andlang=en where they say you should use gloves when handling it, don't use it on skin that is not intact (the effect of using it on broken skin is similar to eating it) and warn of effects on unborn children and male reproductive organs if it's accidentally ingested, plus lots more health warnings."
negative,"My husband and I tried this recipe out and we were saddened by the results.The chicken didn't have much flavor at all, and was dry.I even added a bit of chicken stock because I was worried it might be dried out since there wasn't much liquid in there.The main probably was that you couldn't taste any of the spices from the hot sauce or from the chipotles.Not sure what went wrong.Hopefully someone else has better luck. "
negative,"Not sure what I did wrong.. I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only difference was I made buttermilk using the vinegar/milk trick. My cornbread came out flat (about an inch thick) and dense. Kind of like pound cake... ugg will not make again."
negative,"I made the cake with whole wheat flour.That may have been my first mistake.I don't know what I did wrong but this turned out to be the ugliest cake I have ever seen!The frosting was as thick as peanut butter.It was a weird cake, we ended up throwing most of it away."
negative,"I was looking for a splashy Easter dessert to serve, but I didn't like this cake.Extremely dense cake actually squeezed the frosting out of the layers it was so heavy.At 42 fat grams per serving, I didn't think the taste was worth the calories. Sorry!"
negative,"Sorry to be contrary, but as an experienced baker I found that these were NOT AMAZING at all!I followed the recipe as listed here. They were dense and tasted too heavily of matzo and not much else. I will continue to look for something that has more flavor and is a bit lighter."
negative,"Wow. I did NOT enjoy these shrimp AT ALL!I am SO disappointed!I doubled the recipe thinking I would LOVE the shrimp (based on the great reviews), but the spices were VERY overwhelming.There was also WAY to much heat for my tastes! Yikes!I will NOT be making these again!"
negative,This cake just didn't do it for me. No guilt and no taste! Sorry!
negative,"Our family loves Edamame and loves chinese-style stir dries, but no one liked the dish."
negative,"This was WAAAAYYY too much cream cheese. I even added extra corn, almost doubling the amount of corn and it was still too much. Disappointing, it sounded so good."
negative,"I followed this to the letter and I ended up with a bowel of goop. Tasty goop, but it was still goop"
negative,I was disappointed with this dish.The rice turned out too soft and the fish sauce overwhelmed the dish.The fishy taste lingered all night!
positive,"Excellant mashed potaotes , lots of flavour.Served them for Easter turkey dinner.Love the onion garlic combo, I was out of thyme and will try it next time and i will be making them again. Also left off the last drizzle of butter to save a few calories.Thanks for posting!!"
positive,This is so good!I did make a couple of changes inlcuding a pecan sandy cookie crust with about 1/4 cup toasted coconut and 1/4c. butter mixed with the cookie crumbs.I also substituted 1 tsp coconut extract for the almond. The rest I followed.I like the dense consistency of this type of cheesecake. I took it to Easter dinner and it was a big hit.
positive,"Awesome rolls!I make these by hand as I don't have a bread machine, and they turn out perfect every time.Last time I somehow completely blanked on the egg altogether, and they STILL turned out lovely.Maybe a little bit sweeter than they would have if I'd remembered the egg, but definitely still amazing."
positive,"A well, enjoyed healthy treat for us tonight.This is something I normally wopuld not try, but we all enjoyed it, it was very good and flavorful and healthy. Made for 1-2-3 hits."
positive,"Wow!These are great and a lot of fun to make too.Recipe makes a lot of crispy, tasty cookies that you just can't stop eating!Thanks, Sarah Chana, for passing on this yummy recipe."
positive,This is absolutely the best lasagna!! I used all sausage and added an extra egg to the cottage cheese mixture. Baked it almost an hour because we made it the night before. It set up quickly and we were able to cut perfect pieces. Everyone raved about it. Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.
positive,"This was very good, a nice change from plain rice. I will make this again. Thanks for posting. Made C 2009."
positive,"This was easy and fast. The meat was tasty and flavorful. My family(I'm a family of one) and friends enjoyed it a lot. the spice was just right,not too spicy,just enough to kick the taste buds. Will make again. Made for PAC 2009"
positive,"This soup was wonderful! I halved the recipe but still used the fullamount of potatoes, and I think next time I'll even add a bit more! I used four large strips of bacon, which I fried on the stove, instead of using the bacon bits. Then I used the bacon grease to sautee the garlic and onion before adding it to the soup to give more of the bacon flavor. Fantastic recipe; I'll definitely be making it again!"
positive,"Being Easter season, I used pink and red jelly beans. I ahd the kids help me with this, and the outcome was terrific.A great recipe with so many variations for different types of possibilities throughout the year.Made for PRMR tag."
positive,"Turned out a lovely bird, thanks for posting,Very much like I have always cook my turkey.I did not make your stuffing, I made our regular turkey stuffing, sausage water chestnug.We thouroughly enjoyed it for Easter dinner."
positive,"OMG.This was so easy to make.I used my mandolin for all the veggies.I thought the dressing tasted a little funny as I made it, but once I had it WITH the salad....WOW.No one could stop eating this and I was more than happy to take what little leftovers of it we had, home.I made it about 24 hours ago, and just had another bowl and was happy to find out that it really WASN'T soggy and just as good!Definitely a keeper!! THANK YOU for submitting this!"
positive,"I made this today for Easter supper.I've never been that fond of ham.I've tried a number of different recipes over the years as other family members do enjoy a ham dinner.This is a winner and in my keeper file. We all, including me, thought it was fantastic and the only thing remaining on the serving platter was the bone. So glad I tried this.Thank you kittencal"
positive,"Very good!! I used frozen cranberries and just made a half recipe. Also I added a teaspoon of corn starch to thicken it a little and cut back on the sugar, actually i used splenda.Thanks for posting an easy quick one!!"
positive,These were great!I ended up using 4 tubes in a 9x13 and had to cook it for about 20+ minutes but I think they were a bit too squished together when done.Next time I'll use 3 tubes and give them a little breathing room.
positive,Deeeeelicious!!!I had strawberries to use up and found this recipe (it sounded much better than a jello pie); I am so glad I tried it!I added a couple pinches of granulated sugar to the cream cheese and it was just right.I highly recommend this pie.
positive,"Pretty good! This was the first time i had ever made popovers! Used garlic salt instead of regular and nixed the parmesan and used medium cheddar. I used 1/2tsp herbes de provence, and next time I will surely use less and deffinately try just basil!! Thanks Sharon for sharin'!"
positive,I baked 2 pounds of 31-40 count as an Easter appetizer.Wow!Everyone couldn't stop eating them!My friend was amazed that the recipe was so simple.The only change I made was that I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs since that is what I had on hand.I think the seasoning gave them added flavor so I will continue to use in the future.Thank you Marie!
positive,Made for Easter Egg Hunt Game.SIMPLE FUN and YUMMY!So easy and the cake melts in your mouth.We all enjoyed this cake.
positive,"I used a yellow cake mix with this filling, subbing half the shortening with unsalted butter. I glazed the top with a thin buttercream (more milk, less sugar, no meringue powder, etc.) and then decorated with easter sprinkles and pastel sugars. Chose jumbo baking cups, which made for a sinful, generous portion. Everyone loved 'em! Thank you!"
neutral,"A nice veggie combination but the timing is off, the leeks were cooked but the carrots and turnip were quite underdone. We did like the combination of flavours and the basil was perfect for it, if I try it again I will work it out so the turnip and carrots go in first and cook longer and add the leek later.Thanks for posting."
neutral,A tasty cookie but too sweet for me. I found the ammount of sugar way too much! I don't know if I made something wrong but the cookies turn out like Shortbread cookies. I halfed the ammount and I got25 big cookies. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made it for PAC Spring 2009.
neutral,"I'm giving it 3 stars because some thought it was a 2 and some a 4.I'm among those thinking 2.I did make some substitutions, though.I used egg substitute instead of egg, canola oil and shallots.I also had to double everything because of a large crowd.To me it just had an odd texture, similar to quiche but not quite.And I definitely needed to add more spices for flavoring.I may try it again someday and follow the recipe more exactly and add more flavor."
neutral,"It might be a tasty PUREED spinach, but it's not CREAMED spinach without the addition of either white sauce or cream, or both."
neutral,Good. Easy.
neutral,"Maybe I did something wrong? After even 1 1/2 hours of cooking, mine was mushy. The color was this purple/grey- that the kids refused to even consider. My husband and I treated it liked mashed potatoes and put on butter and cheese. The taste was good, but the color and texture were a problem. I used skin on, red potatoes and baked uncovered."
neutral,"I hate to be the lone voice of not such rave reviews. I just didn't find this all that tasty. I agree that an increase in feta might have helped. Following the suggestion of others, I put the kale in raw at Step 6 and it cooked just fine. I just didn't care for the taste of this dish."
neutral,"This is pretty good for a light dessert.However, I was a little disappointed in that there wasn't enough orange flavor to it.Kinda like eating a helping of Cool Whip.Would like to try it again with less cool whip and more jello.Used everything sugar free to make this including the mandarin oranges.Thanks for sharing your recipe."
neutral,"Prepared for our Easter Dinner.We liked it OK, but may not make it again right away."
neutral,"I had such dreams for this recipe.It is just a shame that the measurements really do not apply to one coffee mug (20 oz size).I think if you were to evenly divide this between two mugs the mixture would not overflow as it ""bakes"" in the microwave.The taste is a bit strange - don't know what is causing it but it is a tad bitter.I think with some tweaking this could work out well.I did use the option of some chocolate chips to sweeten it a bit more.Made for Pick A Chef Spring 2009 event."
neutral,This was o.k. I might make it again if in a pinch as it goes together quickly. Thanks.
neutral,"Even though this is a great concept, I wasn't particularly pleased with these pancakes, they were too thin and too ""eggy"" tasting.I might try this again but with some personal adjustments."
neutral,"I read some reviews that said they made it in a crock-pot and it turned out great, so I tried it too...but it turned out so liquidy that I doubled the meat and it still turned out looking like a soup. I wonder if more liquid might have evaporated betteron the stove? I will try that next time. Flavor was fine but I expected the beer, coffee, and cocoa flavors to come through a bit more. I couldn't notice them at all."
neutral,"This didn't turn out for me, I will have to try it again soon. I baked for about 15 min, but the cookies were still very soft, almost not done, even when they cooled they wouldn't harden. The taste was what I hoped for, a real buttery shortbread! Made for Spring PAC 09. thank you for sharing!"
neutral,"This was just so-so for us. It was very bland. I made it exactly as written, but next time I would make some changes. I would spice up the chicken before I cooked it with some mexican spice mix, and I'd also add some sliced jalapeno's and maybe some cumin to the beans. I would make this again, but only with those changes. Made for PAC Spring 09."
neutral,"I made this for Easter Dinner as one of my Entrees, it was a split, some people really liked it and others not so much..."
neutral,"This was a great idea, but mine were very very soggy in the center. I would put the refried beans on the bottom or top only, not in each layer. They tasted great and made a large amount, great for a party. Will make again, with a little modification  Made for PAC spring 09."
neutral,For some reason these came out runny for us..Maybe my potatoes were too small?
neutral,This casserole was good but not fantastic for us.It was definitely better than it's boxed counter-part.Unfortunately after watching the leftovers sit for a week in the fridge I'm not sure we'll make it again.Sorry.
neutral,"The rice is ok it not great at all, it lacks a strong flavor porfile. "
