negative,"Not at all what I expected.These were really bland and tasteless.I even added a little extra spice, apple and used a flavored instant oatmeal.The low sugar part was absolutely right."
negative,I cut the sugar down and it was still too sweet for us.Kind of a gooey center and the edges stick to the loaf pan and I even greased and floured the pan.
negative,I was not impressed at all bythis had too much of a flour taste and it didn't have that sticky top that I love
negative,"My family did not care for this at all.The flavor was bland, even with the good balsamic vinegar.I used fresh rosemary, two teaspoons was too much.The color was unappetizing as well.Total waste of my time and ingredients."
negative,"This is a recipe for soup.<br/><br/>What a waste of a shopping trip, ingredients, energy and, most importantly, much anticipated meal! I had Gorgonzola cheese fries at a restaurant and the sauce was thick, creamy and delicious. This is not that recipe so in case you thought it was you should definitely never ever make this."
negative,"I have this in the oven now and it will most likely be pretty good.Unfortunately, the recipe itself needs some editing.Step 2 calls for salt to be mixed with other dry ingredients, yet no salt is listed in the ingredients.(I used 1/2 tsp.)The ingredients list 1 eggs -- I'm sure it meant to use 1 egg.The ingredients are not grouped well.The ones for the sugar/cinnamon topping should be the last ones listed, yet they are mixed in with the rest of the ingredients and I also question the amount of cinnamon.1/3 tsp couldn't possibly be noticed when mixed with 3/4c of sugar.I used 1-1/2 tsp.I'm sure this will be pretty sweet, but I must say that unless it turns out tasting really good, I won't be bothered making this one again.I don't care to rewrite recipes -- especially the first time making one."
negative,"This disaster was a failure for me. I made the salad dressing ahead of time, and stored it in the fridge for 2 days. Then made the salad the morning of, exactly as the recipe recommended, but had to store it in my fridge for 4 hours before the dinner event I was bringing it to. By the time I arrived at the party, the salad was a soupy mess. The dressing tasted fattening, vinegary and oily. Thumbs down. I won't make this again."
negative,"I made this for our family reunion today and we didn't like it at all.I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out bland with a slightly odd taste.I must admit though, I was expecting it to taste like pumpkin pie, this wasn't close to the taste.I think maybe I need to add some more sugar and definitely more spices."
negative,"I was very hopeful that these would be good, but I'm not impressed.I used a brownie mix so they are plenty sweet, but they still taste undercooked.I wish there was some way to fluff them up to the texture of a brownie."
negative,Biscuits were so so and the gravy wasn't good at all.thin with little flavor.No one would tounch it.
negative,If you want your chili to taste like tacos with beans then this is the recipe for you. I won't be making chili with taco seasoning or condensed soup again.On the plus side it is easy to make.
negative,This was just too creamy for us and the soup gave it a processed flavor.I would not make this again.
negative,This was just too creamy for us and the soup gave it a processed flavor.I would not make this again.
negative,not so hot bugals just did not cut it
negative,"Followed instructuions, too heavy and it is lacking flavor.Needs vanilla and a int of cinnamon.<br/>No one cared for it."
negative,"felt like a 7 lb loaf.Was wet in the center and the ouyter edges were burnt.<br/>I won't make this again,"
negative,"I'm not sure what went wrong here, but I thought this recipe was...not good. It was bland to say the least. The crust was the only good part about it."
negative,"I did not like these at all, sorry. Tastes like flour, very bland. They were easy to make but I'd rather go without. Blah. I have no clue how this had 5 star ratings in the past."
negative,"Alfredo soup.After 4 mins. went by and sauce was still not thickening, I started to get concerned.But it soon started to curdle and all was lost.I hate bad instructions.Ruined my meal.This recipe is not worth it."
negative,This is worse than bad.It is so greasy fatty and heavy...more like a custard than a refreshing ice cream that it is supposed to be.Shame on the author of this recipe.It is very bad.Don not waste time or ingredients making it!!!
positive,"Quick, and easy to make. This cake is delicious and always a big hit!"
positive,"I agree with the above reviewers that these muffins are great.Made them as per the recipe, using dates and blueberries.The blueberries were amazing - I highly recommend them.I did find the dates were a bit too sweet for me in the recipe.I think the muffins are actually a little on the sweet side without the dates (maybe because my bananas were super-ripe, almost black), so next time I will leave out dates and possibly reduce the brown sugar."
positive,"AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING! These are the best brownies. My 12yr old niece and I made these for the first time and they were great! We used semi-sweet and white chocolate chips, a chocolate glaze, and topped with more white chips. They are like a molten lava cake meets brownie. Wow!"
positive,"Wow!! Great recipe. I have never had a chocolate chip cookie I liked, so I wasn't expecting to much from the recipe. I couldn't stop eating them!! I used pumpkin spice pudding mix and 1/2 semi-sweet and 1/2 white chocolate chips. This will be a recipe I use over and over again."
positive,Excellent!! I can't wait to try this recipe again. I accidentally burned this pretty badly and it was still really good. I know it will be perfect next time. Thanks!
positive,"This is fantastic! My husband is constantly asking for it. He even invited the entire neighborhood over for a ""soup supper"" just so I would make it!"
positive,i had to substitute stone ground mustard and it still was delicious!thanks for sharing!
positive,I too think a great deal of Chef Chen and did of his father as well. I am under the weather with a sinus infection and always go for this or Thai when I am ill. This is a fiercely fiery dish but addictive and always just what the doctor ordered! I love this recipe and I swear I recover more quickly. Thanks for posting; nice to see this here!!
positive,This is the best quick chocolate cake ever.It's is heaps easy and tastes very nice.Perfect.Thanks for the great recipe.
positive,Delish!!This is definitely going to be a keeper!
positive,"This was a yummy and easy breakfast that kept me going for quite a while afterwards. Loved the combination of the mellow banana flavour with the cold milk. YUM!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing your recipe here with us, Acadia!<br/>Made and reviewed for your being VIP during Veggie Swap #28 November 2010."
positive,"WOW, this was super yummy! It tasted very much like pumpkin pie and was very filling and satisfying. I love how healthy this is compared to real pie!<br/>I reduced the sugar to 1 tbs as that was all I needed to sprinkle my ramekin. THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this tasty treat with us, Boomie!<br/>Made and reviewed for the Eating Well Event in the Photo Forum November 2010."
positive,"WOW, this was super yummy! I never even thought of making guacamole with cucumber, but its a perfect match. The cool and crisp cucumber with the smooth avocado is just wonderful both in texture and taste!<br/>Loved how healthy this was, too!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this great recipe with us, Rita! <br/>Made and reviewed for Veggie Swap #28 November 2010 and the Eating Well Event in the Photo Forum."
positive,"Oh this is soooooo good! It tastes exactly like the marinara sauce in our favourite Italian Restaurant. YUM!<br/>The garlic, onion and parsley are the perfect match to the fruity tomato. Mmmm!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this easy and super yummy recipe with us, BK!<br/>Made and reviewed for Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap #46 November 2010 - Group Beetroot."
positive,"Our hands-down favourite contest entry!Besides being dead easy to make, with excellent instructions, I got to use my crockpot and made a terrific-tasting, healthy meal for my family, that we all enjoyed.The chili was well-flavoured and hearty and, served with the freshly-baked tortilla chips and toppings, truly delicious.Having made a couple of other contest entries before this one, that didn't go over so well, the family was not thrilled with the idea of beans for dinner.Well, this recipe will be made over and over again as no one could fault it in any way (and I'm including 3 sometimes-fussy kids in this review).Thank you for making dinner delightful!"
positive,"Oh YUM! These muffins are sooooooo good! They taste very coconutty with a lovely fruity sweetness from the raisins and great crunch from the nuts (I used almonds). Mmm!<br/>I opted for the more healthy version, so I used applesauce in place of the oil and also all whole spelt flour in place of the normal flour. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 tbs for half the recipe and that was plenty for us. Loved this as an easy to make, quick and healthy breakfast!<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for sharing this wonderful recipe with us, Crafty Lady!<br/>Made and reviewed for the Aussie/NZ Recipe Swap #46 November 2010 - Group Beetroot."
positive,"Yep, the absolute best pizza sauce ever.Hands down, no question, don't even THINK you'll find anything tastier.I have finally found the nirvana of pizza sauce."
positive,"This was one of my favorite discoveries during the Dining on a Dollar contest.Although the recipe has few ingredients it delivers on flavor and turns a can of tuna into satisfing meal.I sampled the recipe and then stirred in some chopped tomatoes, green onions, and cilantro left over from a taco bar meal.The additional color of the veggies was welcome in the salad, but almost anything could be added successfully.I served onromaine.Thank you for your entry and good luck!"
positive,"A well deserved 5 stars for a satisfying comfort food meal! This was like a pumped up and seasoned version of shephard's pie.I reduced the recipe by half and still ended up with six generous servings.I did make a few changes to utilize what I had on hand starting with lean ground pork instead of the cubes.Iused 1 can of black beans instead of using two half cans, had to substitute velvetta for half of the cheddar, and included the optional italian seasoning.The filling was well seasoned without being too spicy encased with creamy cheese and then topped by roasted garlic potatoes. I appreciated the finishing touch of the onion flakes. They browned and were little crispy bits on the top.All diner's were happy and gave it a thumb's up.Thank you for your entry and good luck!"
positive,"This was a delicious fall treat! I did have to tweak a few ingredients, but like it you said it would, the bread still came out great. I used 2 small granny smith apples, gluten free flour, 1 c. brown sugar, a full teaspoon of vanilla, egg beaters, melted butter, and dried cranberries. The result was very moist with a fabulously crunchy top and the perfect balance of tangy and sweet. Thank you for posting!"
neutral,"Pretty good.The flavours were not bad, but we all thought it was missing a little 'zing' and maybe some chopped jalapeno to take it on a tex-mex journey, or a dash of curry to go in another direction, would have really added some nice spice.I think, also, the beans would have been easier to handle in a dip if they had been coarsely fork-mashed, just enough to show they're still beans, but also to blend them into the tuna dip part better."
neutral,"I'm in a bad place about reviewing this recipe - it tasted fine - not a 5-star, but it could have been a 4-star (although it really needed fewer olives, but that's adjustable, as they're added at the end).My problem is with the instructions.It's not just the way they appear oddly (and hopefully, after the contest ends, some serious editing will clean this up), it's the fact that the recipe completely neglects to mention at what point the beans and rice are added, and if they're added together or not?I winged it and, as I said, dinner was fine, but this is by no means a 'perfect' recipe, and I have to take this into consideration so as not to shortchange another recipe that tastes just as good, but is written better."
neutral,"This was a hit and a missdue to the vinegarey flavor.One liked the sweet/ tart contrast, but other diners were less impressed. The only change made to the recipe was to use brown sugar Splenda. I was excited over how well the kidney beans worked for this.I hadn't used them before for baked beans and was pleased by how they softened and absorbed the flavors.I also liked the hint of heat from the jalapeno.Thank you for your entry!"
neutral,"I loved how creative and healthy this recipe was. I followed the directions exactly, but still had a hard time getting the cakes to stay together. I liked the sesame taste but overall found the cakes to be a bit dry. The sauce was nice. Thank you for being creative with your recipe creation. "
neutral,"This is pretty good, a little on the bland side but could be spiced up a bit, definitely needs salt.Will probably make again with more spices, it's cheap, easy and good for you too!"
neutral,"Great idea and the beans worked well, but just to strong on the vinegar."
neutral,"This was ok. I always love trying crock pot recipes because they are so easy, but I don't think I will be making this again. Thanks for the idea!"
neutral,This was just okay for me.I stirred in a little Thai red curry paste and liked it better.I also thickened it and used it as a sauce on pork!
neutral,"This came out pretty well.Perhaps it was missing something, but I don't know what."
neutral,"I did think the ingredients were unusual, but I liked them all.It didn't quite work as a final product, however.I did not like the tuna with the beans.The flavor definitely improved after letting the dip sit for a while and mature."
neutral,"This was ok, but not as flavorful as I'd hoped. I think there are too many tomatoes for my taste. I added some taco seasoning and chili beans to see if that would help, but it still wasn't as good as tortilla soup I've had before."
neutral,Made this today as a side dish to go with our baked chicken. Not a favorite. I felt it was a little on the dry side. I did add some can milk and velveeta cheese to try to add more of a creamier texture. Good taste just not a favorite.
neutral,This was OK for us. Hubby did not like the way the beer tasted in the meat (and he loves beer). I used Budweiser as that is what he drinks but he did not like it. I was the only one that would eat it.
neutral,"It was too spicy for our tastes, and we normally like stuff with just a little kick.Also, I added garlic powder, Knorr beef bouillon, and other spices to give it more flavor."
neutral,"I never had it at Outback but it def didn't do it for me. It wasn't bad, It just wasn't for me, the cheese mushroom and bacon was okay but the honey mustard and seasonall chicken was a no go. I think this is a dish of personal taste. Part of me feels that I should never order this from Outback because now I know I wouldn't like it but my other half is saying, give it a try, see what all these people are raving about."
neutral,"These were easy to make and they stayed together once cut up so they were good for packed lunches for the kids.The downside was that they were too dry.Some other reviewers have suggested adding things like apple sauce so while I think I will make them again, I will experiment more with cinnamon and perhaps apple juice.With the next batch, I'm going to swap apricot for apple and sultanas and see how that goes, but basically it's a good recipe - just needs a bit of tweaking."
neutral,I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought.It was too sweet.I may try with more tequila another time.Thanks Gailanng Made for the Australian Recipe swap for November 2010
neutral,"I gave these 3 stars, not because they aren't good, but because they were just OK. I took them to a church event and there was an overwhelming consensus that they all preferred the classic chocolate chip cookie without the instant pudding. I think that the cookie is good, but because it's different than what most are used to, it can disappoint when people are expecting the classic."
neutral,"Either I'm doing something wrong or everyone else is crazy. I made this last night and it didn't taste anything like Olive Garden's. It was pretty good, but definitely not the same. A tip for the expensive Fontina cheese: I found it in our deli at Publix (but not at Wal Mart) and got a slice (I think the thickness was ""3"" but I don't know anything about that stuff) which was about 3 tablespoons worth. It cost me 70 cents. Like I said, not bad, but certainly not like Olive Garden's."
neutral,"Not a bad quick meal, but not what I would normally call beef stroganoff"
