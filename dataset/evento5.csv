negative,This recipe had the advantage of including ingredients I already had in the house.But it was way too bland for us.I even added an extra can of green chilies.I'll have to keep looking for a chicken enchilada recipe that we like.
negative,These have no flavor and were very dry. Are they supposed to have milk or something in them?
negative,"I followed this recipe exactly, measured carefully and it came out a gooey mess and just not good.I cooked it 25 minutes beyond the prescribed 1 hr at 350 degrees and it was still gooey and raw in the middle.I ended up throwing it out and will not be making this again."
negative,"Gross. I was very excited for this recipe, followed the instructions very carefully. The chicken was incredibly dry (I followed the cooking time), the sauce was really bland, and it did not taste good at all. I'll just make Parma Rosa pasta the regular way."
negative,I made these per the recipe and they came out either sponge-like or just leathery but not crispy. (The eggplant was slice very thin so it wasn't a matter of them being too thick.) We ended up just throwing them out.
negative,"This was way to much work. After the coconutstopped sticking I had to go to a back up of panko crumbs, which always taste great.You must be a coconut lover because the coconut overpowers the subtle flavor of the shrimp."
negative,I know that I'm in the minority but this recipe did not work out for me at all.I made 48 mini cupcakes and 12 regular sized with this recipe and they turned out hard as a rock and crumbly.I couldn't even get the paper wrappers off of them.I didn't care for the flavor. That might have been the cocoa I used but I tend to think not as it tastes great when I make Recipe #32204.I ended up throwing it all away and scraping my pans because of the overflow.This may turn out if you are making a pan cake but I do not recommend it for cupcakes.
negative,I am a baker and i tried these cookies last night and they were a total desaster. The dough was nice and they cooked up nice and fluffy in the oven but once i took them out to cool they went flatter than a pancake and to chewy. They flavor was nice while they were warm but when they got cold they were just a mess. I had high hopes for this recipe after reading all the wonderful post and rating but it was a desaster for me but I do plane to try this recipe again in the near future incase i may have done something wrong.
negative,"Instructions should be altered: ice cream would have been a lot better melted. I did some research online and found from other recipes instructing to use MELTED ice cream. I used ice cream straight from the freezer, and the dough was SO hard to work through! I ended up with some batter being doughy and some sludgy; it was very uneven. Will try that next time; I'm giving it a low rating because of the flawed instructions."
negative,We didn;t care for the taste of sour cream.
negative,this is ok. but I have an easier recipe: 4-6 chicken breasts and 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup. Dump into crockpot and cook on low for 6-8 hours.
negative,Sorry. We didn't like this at all.
negative,We baked this for 30 mins and it's still not done. Took more like 45 mins. The end result was only ok.
negative,"This was like an extremely dry scone.It had no personality, even when I used blueberry sauce (#186774) to help it out.Is something missing, or did I do something seriously amiss?It had a lot in common with a cinnamon-flavored hockey puck."
negative,"I'm afraid I didn't care for this one.It was easy enough, sure, and it smelled fabulous, but following the directions, I ended up with the texture of a kid's bouncy ball.Did I do something wrongly perhaps?Since I couldn't use panko, I had to use coarse matzo meal.Could that have something to do with the poor result?"
negative,"My family didn't like it.Mine was grainy maybe because I used 2%milk.Also, 4 -16oz bags of cheese is alot.I used 4- 8 oz bags and that was alot.It didn't turn out creamy."
negative,"I'm sorry but this came out awful. I put in all the ingredients, including the broth, but when I checked on it at 5.5 hours it was already burning! Unheard of for crockpot recipes. I added extra water (1.5 cups) and let it cook a bit longer.When it was finally done I put it over rice and veggies and we just didn't care for it at all. It was way too salty (broth + soy sauce?) and it didn't have a peanut flavor at all. I think the soy sauce really overpowered it.Sorry, I really wanted to like this!"
negative,one ingredient too many.
negative,"I substituted the flour with whole wheat flour, and omitted cocoa as I don't have any in hand; but the results was quite poor - the texture was extremely dry and hard, neither chewy nor soft and airy."
negative,"I was skeptical but intrigued at the same time so I gave it a try.We grind our own flour, both Hard and Soft wheat.For this recipe I decided to go with Soft.I followed the directions but omitted the brown sugar (acceptable per the instructions) because I was making a savory dish (Tomato Pie).I pre-baked for 5 minutes and tested the edge.I suspected it probably wouldn't hold together as it was so crumbly, almost powdery, but I wanted to follow it through.Poked holes in the bottom, made the pie and baked for about 30 minutes.I tested the edge again with the same results.Let the pie cool for almost an hour before we cut it and ate.It totally disintegrated in to a powdery mess in the pie.Thankfully, it didn't alter the flavor of the dish.This recipe may work best for sweet dishes with the addition of the brown sugar or other sweetener to melt/carmelize and help hold it together.Even though it didn't work for me, like I said, it didn't actually ruin the overall flavor of my dish so no harm done.Just wish I could give it better marks but thanks for sharing!"
positive,These were so so so good!!! I used green raisins and they turned out great!! Thanks for posting!!!
positive,"Very delicious!I only used 1/2 teaspoon of salt and it was plenty I think.I used 2 chicken breasts and pounded them flat and used 1/2 the butter. We are used to light meals, so I think next time I will thin out the sauce with water or ff milk because when you 1/2 the butter you obviously get less sauce, but it's still very rich and delicious if you're used to lighter fare so thinning the sauce to make more of it is an option....great recipe!"
positive,What an easy and delicious recipe!One change I made was to use fresh pineapple chunks in place of the canned pineapple.I also doubled the marinade and used the leftover to baste the veggies and fruit while on the grill. The chicken was very tender after marinating and all of the flavors complemented each other beautifully. We will use this recipe again and again.
positive,"These made a perfectly wonderful evening meal with no other dishes on the side. Fantastic flavours and texture. DH whispered in awe, 'can we have these again tomorrow?': )I made the filling a day ahead to let the flavours build and to save time. Thank you so much. I'd like to serve these portabella's as a first course when we have company, and follow up with a light Italian entree."
positive,Made this for dinner with the in-laws.Everybody loved it.Hubby says make this again.I did add rasins.Otherwise followed the recipe. The ingredients are what you would have on hand nothing expensive or exotic but turns out YUMMMM! Thanks for posting this.It was great served warm from the oven with whipped cream and ice cream.
positive,"Quite a process, but the result is excellent.As a previous reviewer mentioned, we weren't used to caraway and dill in them, but it's a natural fit and they are delicious.These are larger than I usually make them, and they don't stay round in a flat skillet; I think I'd make them a little smaller when I make them again. We did spoon on extra berries afterward. Great recipe, great supper. Made for Zaar World Tour 6 for the Voracious Vagabonds."
positive,"Basic, good, and easy.Served as a side to Swedish Meatballs, they were perfect.Made for Zaar World Tour 6, for the Voracious Vagabonds."
positive,Use this recipe all the time!!Not why it took so long to write a review.Marinade it for a few hours and I use my Foreman Grill.Lovely flavour.Serve it with cilantro rice and a tomato and avocado salad. Yummy leftovers too
positive,"First off, understand what you're getting.This is not everyday bread, and this is not American bread. This is a holiday treat for a region where most bread is formulated to dry out and keep a long time.This is dark, heavy, slightly sweet rye bread and it is intended to be that.Part of our family did not like the fennel seed, and I'm sure it could be made without it for preference at the expense of authenticity. Made for Zaar World Tour 6 for the Voracious Vagabonds."
positive,"Husband is a tow truck driver and his uniforms are covered in miscellaneous stains that are difficult to remove: oil, grease, blood, food (eating and driving), sweat, etc.It removed these stains better than the expensive store brand!It also removed black dye that bled onto one of my favorite white sweaters.Also useful in removing dark deoderant stains from clothes.I used the washing machine method, but I left the clothes soaking over-night (because I forgot about them) - the clothes were beautiful and undamaged!!Great recipe.Thanks for sharing!"
positive,I loved this sandwichI loved this sandwich! I used Splenda and sourdough bread. I will make this often. Thanks for sharing the recipe.
positive,I made this tonight and really enjoyed it. Very quick to make and goes well with warm bread. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for ZWT6.
positive,"This was a fantastic dish! We all loved it and I will add it to my regular rotation, especially during the summer. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for ZWT6."
positive,"So I followed Lee's suggestions and put 12 peppercorns in the bottom and cut my peppers in slivers for colorful accents in my jars.I used 3 jalapenos with all seeds for spice split between the 9 jars.6 lbs of carrots made 9 pint jars not 6 pint jars, but it just meant more to share today so I didn't mind at all having the extra product.At a friend suggestion we are going to let them pickle in the jar for about 2 months before opening so I haven't tasted them yet, but just the carrots in the pickle juice were pretty yummy so I'm excited to try them fully spiced soon!"
positive,"I liked this dish very much. I used shallots. The peas tasted so good that I hesitated to add the cheese. Some liked the cheese on it, but I preferred the part underneath, without the cheese. Really nice flavor to the dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe. Made for ZWT6"
positive,This salad is a delicious combination of ingredients and was quick and easy to put together.Very light and fresh-tasting.Made for ZWT6.
positive,"These had a very nice flavor and were very quick and easy to make.However, mine spread out all over the place and were more like cookies than buns.They reminded me of the drop biscuits my mom used to make.I would make these again.Made for ZWT6."
positive,I'd eat it with a spoon if they let me! I put on a nice smoaked salmon sandwhich for dinner. DELICIOUS! Thanks Sharon  Made for ZWT 6 by fellow Looney Spoon Phoodie.
positive,This made the nicest lunch served with recipe #423193 and recipe #424502. I halved the recipe and cut the shrimp into large chunks before mixing into the mayo mixture. The dill and horseradish were a great combo with the cayenne adding just the right heat. I did give it a small squeeze of lemon from the garnish and it brightened up the dish. Thanks for sharing. Made for Scandinavian region of ZWT6.
positive,Great idea! I love cedar planked foods as well and this is a great way to have the planks ready to go. I could see the salt really worked and got a lot less scorching of the plank than usual so apart from being quick and convenient it's a great way to get more life from your planks.
neutral,These were OK for us. We didn't think they had much flavor to them. I followed the recipe exactly as written. I crushed a bouillon cube in about 1/4 cup of water and added that and that gave it more flavor.
neutral,I put steak into flour then fried in olive oil until flour disappeared then put in crock-pot. Poured the rest of the ingredients over steak except carrots I used one can of carrots and put right before serving. Thank you for sharing. Was delicious.
neutral,"These were easy to make, and I liked the idea of croutons as a coating.However, we found them bland.My husband and I both agreed they needed a sauce or a dip or something.I will agree with other reviewers that they're easily portable - I took one for lunch the next day and ate at room temp.One really bright spot was that my 2 year old really liked it and was able to hold it and feed herself.In summary, they were fine, but I probably won't make again."
neutral,"Both liked and disliked this recipe.The tofu and bok choy came out pretty well.I found the tofu kind of bland, but my wife enjoyed it.The problem was the sauce - it's possible I used the wrong kind of fish sauce, but the fishy smell and taste was extremely overpowering.I had to double everything else in the sauce recipe and then add ginger and garlic to make it palatable.With those adjustments, it came out to a pleasant meal."
neutral,"WHEW!This one is potent!Needs some more sweetness and some more orange flavor in my humble opinion.I cut the recipe in fourths and it made 1 smallish martini.Used regular Absolute vodka and added vanilla as suggested.For the cream, I used whipping cream.Made for Team SSaSSy for ZWT6 Scandinavian weekend."
neutral,"Very glad I found a recipe without needing baking powder as I just ran out of it. I omitted the egg, halved the recipe, used soymilk and balsamic vinegar to substitute buttermilk, and added 1/4 c applesauce - muffin came out OK, but slightly chewy, Will follow the ingredients next time!"
neutral,"This cappuccino has possibilities, and it took me 4 times to make it just the way I like it. I even added sugar to the coffee, then poured it into an ice cube tray to make coffee ice cubes. Once frozen, I added the coffee ice cubes to the blender, to make the cappuccino a bit more thick and icy. When preparing the coffee, I added 1-1/2 teaspoons of instant coffee (Maxwell House) to 4-ounces of water, then heated it in the microwave, and chilled it in the fridge for 30 minutes, before mixing it in the blender.Also, when adding the ice cubes, I found using smaller ice cubes work best in making this beverage.And I used 8 small sized ice cubes. The regular sized ice cubes didn't dissolve completely in the blender, not even after blending this after 2 minutes on high. As for the Splenda, I added 1-1/2 individual packets, plus I also added a bit more vanilla extract (1/4 tsp). Not a bad tasting cappuccino, but one needs to adjust the ingredients to one's liking. Thanx for the recipe TasteTester."
neutral,This was a quick and easy recipe that I made for 4 servings. I did not add the half-and-half which I know would make it richer but I used 2% milk compared to my usual skim so thought it would feel cramy enough for me. It did taste creamy but also it tasted more like mashed potatoes with way too much milk in them. It does have that comforting walm milk feeling and the little bit of butter on top was nice. The allspice tasted like a nice surprise. Thanks for sharing your recipe. Made for the ZWT X-tra Hot Dishes.
neutral,Unfortunately we did not care for this.I thought it would be similar to what I make in a hurry (mac n' cheese w/ground beef) but the milk/egg mixture was more like a soft-set custard rather than a cream sauce.Made for ZWT6 Scandinavia.
neutral,"I made this icing to put on top of mini chocolate cupcakes.I too had to use extra OJ to get the consistency I wanted.I ended up with something like 2 cups of icing, definitely not 4 cups.I don't know if that is because I didn't whip the butter enough before adding the other ingredients.The icing is tinted a pale yellow so I added one drop of red food coloring to tint it to orange.After it sat for awhile the flavor became more pronounced. Overall a good recipe.Thanks!"
neutral,"I'm sorry, but this just didn't do it for me. I don't know why. It sounded so good. Maybe I didn't cook the potatoes quite long enough; I'm not sure. But the potato flavor was too strong and the other flavors didn't blend together well. It felt like it was needing something else - another spice maybe. I'm not sure. Thanks for posting though."
neutral,"Like another reviewer, I live in Iceland where Skyr is made and is popular. I tried this recipe to see if I could make the *real stuff* and did research on it, but this is not authentic Skyr. www.skyr.is/ Skyr is only made from *pasteurized skim milk* as seen on all labels. No other milk (or sour cream) are used and that is why it is virtually fat-free. Even the flavored Skyr is labelled as having a total and saturated fat content of 0%. Since this is a copycat w/none of the health benefits of true Skyr and is fairly labor intensive, I doubt I will make this again. I did enjoy trying it as a pers challenge, so thx for posting."
neutral,"Made this to take to a pig roast. The recipe had some issues -- it was still a little doughy after an hour in a 350F gas oven with convection, and even an additional 8 minutes didn't completely bake it to a dry, fluffy consistency. It may have been my cornmeal (terrible cornmeal from Whole Foods), Also, Iused just 1/2 cup sugar and subbed 2 tablespoons sorghum for a more rustic taste. Or maybe it's supposed to be really moist. Personally, I prefer cornbread hot, salty and greasy, but people mostly seemed to enjoy it with smoked pulled pork."
neutral,"I might try this again, with modifications. I too found it impossible (at least when using fresh chopped spinach) to get the full amount into the 1 1/2 qt casserole. It was too much liquid after baking. I used the water bath and even left it in 15 extra minutes in hopes of evaporating some off. The cheese on top became tough as a result:("
neutral,I cut the recipe down to 10 tarts. I did use the grated horseradish and should have used the sauce which makes a big difference. We both love horseradish and hot and spicy foods but it was a bit to much horseradish...so please use the sauce. I did make my own tart shells. The overall flavor was missing an ingredient or two possibly salt and a herb or even some minced garlic. Thanks for posting. 
neutral,"Too much sugar and butter. I made these to put under gravy and they totally threw the balance off and stole the show, in a bad way to me. Biscuits shoudn't be this sweet. Also, only about 50% of them came out of the muffin pan in one piece due to having too much butter. Thanks for posting!"
neutral,"I follwoed the directions exactly and don't know what I did wrong.There was way too much batter for my cake pans and the cake layers cooked over.I even made 2 custard cup 'cakes'.My cake fell in the middle when I took it out of the pans.Nevertheless, the flavor is delicious.Next time I will use a 9x13 pan and not do layers.Even so, I will definitely try it again."
neutral,I will update this as soon as I hear back from Sweet Baboo . I put the max liquid in and it still ended up too dry. I added another 3 tablespoons water and it was still not a smooth dough. The tops ended up rough but the inside was lighter than most 100% W.W. so I want to work with it to get the recipe right. 2 1/4 tablespoon gluten seems a bit high. I think I will drop that down to 1 tablespoon and see what happens.Cheers!Matt
neutral,"Mizz Nezz, while my husband and I thought this potato salad was ok, I also think it has possibilities.I did halve the amount of onion, as I thought 1 cup was a bit much. Mizz Nezz, I'm sorry I wasn't able to give this recipe more than 3 stars, but I am also glad to see others here enjoyed the salad."
neutral,"We found this to have too much mustard and too much salt.I will make it again, but the next time I will do 2 tsp. of mustard, rather than the 2 Tbl and half the salt.Made that way, it would be a 5 star recipe for us."
