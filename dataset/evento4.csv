negative,"Hi, I tried this without the egg because I thought that was just strange, so maybe that was the thing that made the difference, but mine came out really vinegar-y, salty, and just not good. The flavor was way too strong. Instead of complementing the chicken, it completely dominated. I followed the instructions otherwise and only marinated the chicken for a few hours. The only thing that rescued the meat and made it edible AT ALL was the addition of sugar at the last minute to try and cancel out the vinegar taste. This appealed to me because I had all the ingredients on hand, but I will definitely not make this again. Sorry to give your grandfather's recipe a bad review, though. Thanks for sharing. And again maybe it was my bad for not using the egg."
negative,"I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the water and it turned out watery and flavorless."
negative,I am so sorry to say that this did not turn out for me. It came out completely soupy and runny. I tried to dip a cracker in it to at least get a feel for the flavor and it just was not good.I would definitely recommend that anyone who wants to try this recipe drain the chickpeas.
negative,"This is a good recipe for someone that is not a cook.This was a quite bland, boring pasta dish.It was equal to Pasta Roni boxed meal if that is what you are looking for."
negative,"I am aborting this pie mission after making the ""crust"", which is a disaster.After adding the melted chocolate and butter to the confectioners sugar, it turns into little balls that look and taste horrible; there is no chocolate taste whatsoever.I did not add the 1.5 cups of coconut and I'm grateful that I won't be wasting additional ingredients.There is no way that the crust would press into a pie plate.It's just wrong.Sorry - won't be completing this recipe!"
negative,"I made this salad for our Christmas dinner. It makes for a lovely presentation. I would suggest to anyone making the salad, to sample your celery before using it. The fresh celery I purchased was extremely bitter tasting and it majorly destroyed the flavor of the salad. My family didn't care for the flavor of the fresh cranberries-maybe we're just not cranberry lovers. This was the first time I ever made a salad that no one would eat."
negative,"This whole recipe was off - it made 30 muffins (not 12) and the batter was so wet and gooey that it took over 45 minutes to cook (I followed the recipe exactly).Even after 45 minutes the centers were still not done.The measurements must be off by a lot.I am so disappointed I just wasted all of those ingredients, especially those yummy blueberries!!"
negative,"The recipe uses way too much starch. You should not need but 2 or 3 Tbsps. It is very difficult to coat the chicken with the slurry unless you add some water to the mixture. The sauce was tasty, but it did not taste like general tso's chicken. If you play around with the ingredients a bit you may have better results. However, I will never waste 3 lbs of chicken on this recipe again."
negative,"It was oily and crumbly, it tasted more like flour flavored cornbread than cake.I made them for a Saint Paddy's party and most people took one bite and threw it away."
negative,"Oh dear, I did not enjoy this at all. I am sorry to rain down on the great 5 star parade. I love all the ingredients, but I didn't like it all together and maybe it was because I used fresh chicken breasts, but I felt the chicken was not a nice texture. sorry!"
negative,"How can there be 10 positive reviews for this salad and not one person mention that the ingredients list does not mention spinach at all, yet in the directions it says to add it. How much??Also, in the ingredients list it says 8 oz of swiss cheese, RINSED. WHAT???THIS SALAD WAS A DISASTER for my Easter dinner. Even though I did not ""rinse the swiss cheese"" Perhaps the author can correct and clarify this recipe so I can see what it is really supposed to taste like."
negative,I could not get the nice mozzarella sheet.Perhaps slice deli cheese would have worked better.A waste of expensive ingredients.
negative,"My family and I did not care for this cornbread - it tastes bland and lacked any sort of flavor, which might be a good thing if you're looking for a very plain cornbread, but I guess we're used to a more sweet cornbread.The one plus is that the texture was good, moist and crumbly.Maybe next time I'll just add 1/4 cup of sugar and see if that helps.I doubled the recipe to fill out a 9x9 pan, baked only 18 min and it was done.My family did eat it though after the initial disappointment with the plain flavor, spread it with lots of butter and jam."
negative,Agree with angelchef #2...
negative,"I have no idea what I did wrong?! I followed the recipe to a T and it was too spicy, and then my tamales came out horrible, noone ate them, maybe it was because of the soaking water, because everyone else seems to have gotten good results...:/"
negative,"Forget it.Go with the recipe in Joy of Cooking.Same ingredients, a bit more work but well worth it.I found this recipe very disappointing."
negative,as a non premium member-had a problem with baking powder listed twice and therefore came out tough and bitter-tried to ask chef-or make correction-but said im non member-so no luck--
negative,"I was incredibly disappointed with this recipe and after reading everyone's fantastic reviews I kept wondering what I could've done wrong. ?? I'm pretty convinced I did it exactly as directed.I chose the oven method as I wanted to use the sauce (which BTW was very thin and runny, more like a marinade).But placing the chicken in a 9x13 baking dish with the sauce poured over (making it about 3/4"" deep in sauce) actually made the chicken just taste boiled and not very flavorful. Furthermore, I found squeezing the limes to be quite tedious (since I had to double the recipe) and for the work and the flavor of the sauce I honestly felt I could probably find the results in a good store bought brand.Sorry, but I would not make again.All the food from my party was eaten up and I had one huge plateful of this chicken left."
negative,Needs editing.Do not try as listed!
negative,Made this as written but halved it. I'm sorry but this didn't work for me after 2 1/2 hours I had a glob of scorched cheese and tough elbow macaroni. My slow cooker works fine so that isn't the problem. Made for the Spring 2010 PAC
positive,"This is a great recipe for very tasty carrots! A delicious addition to Recipe #413336 and Recipe #385298 , Thanks for sharing the recipe Kathey. Made for PAC Spring 2010."
positive,"I used wide Amish noodles and they cooked up so well in the parsley-butter sauce. These were scrumptious with Recipe #413336 and Recipe #77943 . Thanks for sharing a super recipe Sharon, Made for PAC Spring 2010."
positive,"Very good--the main youthful recollection I come up with is eating the to-die-for dough. I could make a batch and bypass the baking altogether--ummm. I used coconut oil for the veg. oil and had no crumbliness. I'm curious if I could substitute applesauce, as in a cake? I prefer weighing my dry ingredients, and used the 3.5 C of flour suggestion--might have come up a bit shy on the flour as the batter was nowhere near dry as many say.Also, couldn't force myself to put a Tbsp of baking SODA in, so I used Baking powder. I'm not enough of a cook to know specific the effects of each.I agree that they should be cooled on newspaper--they're rather greasy. Umm, again."
positive,"WOW!So delicious!I often buy a pre-made version from our local farmers market butcher and we love it, but I'm trying to take the J. Oliver approach and ""know my ingredients"" so I wanted to make it myself.....I used our leftover ham from Easter and followed the recipe, cutting back for just 2 servings.The sauce is amazing and it's very easy to make.GREAT recipe!!!!I made sage roasted butternut squash to go with it and the whole meal was a HUGE hit with my husband."
positive,"Num, Num, Num! This was my first time doing anything with kasha and this recipe turned out perfect!!! I halved the recipe but still used 1 egg and I used vegetable broth. This is tasty even without noodles. It tastes very ""meaty"" and I have since used it successfully in Sheperd's Pie. I shared this with my friend who is allergic to gluten, and he was delighted! Thanks a ton Chia "
positive,Yumm.. I love Boboli crust and adding the extra seasonings just made it better. Made with indredients I had on hand.
positive,This is one of my favorite pies. I love the ease in prep. This time I did cherry. I thought about the pineapple but since I am the only one in the household that loves pineapple I thought I would go with the familys favorite. One of these days I WILL use pineapple.
positive,This was a definate keeper. I loved the sauce. I served it over creamy mashed potatoes.
positive,Very good. I left out the jalapeno due to personal preference but otherwise kept everything else.
positive,I love tacos and this was no exception. Yummmmm
positive,This was delicious. I used French Vanilla coffee and French Vanilla creamer. Went together perfectly.
positive,"Well, over 600 reviews to this point and 5 stars... I can do no less. I have now made this dish twice - the first time without pasta sauce, the second time with it; both times I loved the result and got rave reviews from everyone else trying it. And it smells so divine!!! (Word of warning: VERY GARLICKY! Don't expect to be able to hide this from anyone you kiss later!)"
positive,This recipe is the perfect sangria and can be easily adapted to whatever is in your fridge. I used pineapple juice instead of orange juice and vodka instead of brandy and it still came out perfect.
positive,Yummmmm. nice and smooth.
positive,I'm eating this as I type...and omfgdeliciousnesssssssss.
positive,This was a great healthy lunch. One I will definatly make again.
positive,Simply wonderful!This recipe is easyand tasty.Even my 3 year old liked it!
positive,"So good!My whole family gobbled it up, kids and hubby ate 3 servings!Love all the veggies in here.Added 1 lb lean ground turkey for protein, added a 15oz can of beef broth and a 6 oz can of tomato paste.Played with the spices a bit (doubled the chili powder and paprika, kept the cumin as is, forgot the cinnamon).Used the 2 large cans of tomatoes I had on hand (1 was diced, 1 was whole), and simmered for about an hour.This made a huge batch, I'll freeze the extra for another meal.Thanks for the recipe."
positive,"I made this loooong ago, and family loved it.Just made it last week for Easter, and we enjoyed it all over again.I appreciate that it is so easy.I did as someone else had suggested, putting a chopped apple, onion and dried rosemary in with it.Made excellent gravy and a delicious dinner.Will make this over and over and over . . ."
positive,"Mmmmmm!We *loved* these!I reduced the butter to 1/4 cup, as someone else had suggested, and put in raisins, currants, and cut up dried apricots.I watched the machine as it was mixing, and did add more flour.Not sure how much more.I cut the crosses in quite deeply, and could see them when they came out of the oven.Will definitely be making these again.Thanks, Oster71."
neutral,"i thought these were okay; but i've never had whitecastle burgers before, so i cant compare.it was just a bit too oniony for me; i did however, like the idea of dinner rolls/mixing the ketchup and mustard together.my bf, however, thought these were delicious ;)"
neutral,Definatly on the dry side but still good.
neutral,"I agree with the reviewer who thought this lacked flavor. I made a small trial batch and found them to be bland, so I added some garlic, mozzarella and more seasonings in the next batch. I also thought there was too much egg/flour batter (even after reducing the egg since I didn't want them to end up as mini-quiches) which overtook the zucchini in this - I would have preferred that the zucchini shine instead. We still will eat them, and they are definitely good enough to try at least once."
neutral,"This was okay for us but didn't knock our socks off.I used 3 large boneless pork chops and only had seasoned bread crumbs available.I thought the amounts (1/2 Tablespoon and 1 Tablespoon) of salt and pepper, respectively, might be typos so I cut it back to about 1/2-3/4 teaspoon each.I marinated the chops overnight, then breaded and baked.It's a very simple dish and I liked how quickly it came together, but the end result was too eggie-tasting.I wish I had not poured the remaining egg mixture over the meat before baking.I think maybe some butter would have browned the crumbs nicely, but without the scrambled egg flavor.Thanks for sharing, Amy.I may try this again with the chicken and some small tweaks.Made for Spring 2010 Pick A Chef.You've been adopted! http://www.recipezaar.com/bb/viewtopic.zsp?t=327498andpostdays=0andpostorder=ascandstart=0"
neutral,"My husband and I thought this was going to be a go-to meal for us.But I just didn't care for it.I think mostly because I'm not a fresh tomato kind of person.He is, but I'm definitely not.I was sad that I didn't care for this as much as everyone else did.Thanks for posting it!"
neutral,"This recipe took me several tweaks before I was happy with it.I don't know if it was because I used fresh lemon extract (purchased only for this recipe), but the lemon was overpowering.I omitted it altogether.Also, place an oven proof bowl with water in the oven while baking/cooling the cupcakes.This will keep them from looking like shriveled up stuff in a cupcake wrapper.Other than that, very moist."
neutral,"This has a lot of potential, but tastes a little too much like cream of chicken soup.I think next time I will reduce to one can of soup and up to 8 oz of cream cheese.I would probably add more chillis too.Overall, a good starter recipe.I will try again with variations.Reviewed for spring PAC 2010."
neutral,"These were good, but I though the sauce was a little bland.I will try the meatballs again with a different sauce.Reviewed for Spring PAC 2010."
neutral,I find it to be pretty standard roasted veggies.Next time I would replace some oil with water and cover so that it steams up better.
neutral,These were okay. The sauce was a little overpowering.
neutral,"I could never get this to work quite right for me. The center always remained gooey and the edges always got hard, even after trying multiple cooking times/powers. The part that did come out was acceptable though and a welcome change for breakfast besides regular eggs."
neutral,"DD here, and I hate to be a Simon. But this recipe is just too thin. I practically froze it, and was very patient, but I couldn't get it past the soup stage. I see you have commented that you should use less cream if you want it to be like frosting... however, ganache, in it's normal state SHOULD be like frosting, sooo... kind of a fail there. Despite that, it tastes pretty good. I'll probably jar it and use it as chocolate syrup."
neutral,"Very tasty. Substituted Chicken Broth for Water for extra depth of flavor. I think it would be better with Tofu added.On further reflection, I've decided to take away one star. Some modifications would take this recipe up to four stars."
neutral,This was tasty but was essentially blueberries with some crumble scattered on top.I think this could easily be corrected by reducing the amount of blueberries and using a smaller baking dish.I used frozen wild blueberries and made exactly as posted.Made for Spring PAC 2010.
neutral,"I didn't have a wild boar ham but my cheapy ham was very salty.I basted with the cream soda throughout the cooking time and it came out lovely.We prefer a ham that tastes like, well, HAM! The overly sweet or smokey ones just don't cut it with us.This recipe added just the right sweetness and flavor."
neutral,"My daughter and I thought we'd try this quick dessert since we had everything for it.Unfortunatley, it was a disappointing result.Maybe it would be better with a more tart fruit, but there didn't seem to be any contrast between the fruit and the sweet batter.Just kind of bland somehow.Sorry!"
neutral,"Good ""starter"" recipe.We like our chowders thicker so I added a cornstarch slurry toward the end (with the milk).We also find that the corn overpowers most soups, even a corn chowder, so we put that in last and cook just long enough to heat through.I also added 2 more large potatoes as we had extras show up for dinner. (I was actually doubling it already so I used a total of 8 potatoes)Served garnished with chives and Tapatio red pepper sauce along with a basket of hot sourdough bread and butter.Good dinner.[I am stingy with my stars.I only gave 3 stars because this wasn't spectacular as posted; needed just a bit of adjustments.However, that doesn't mean it lacks something... it is a good start that each household can customize or serve as is.]"
neutral,"I'm sorry Pixie, but I guess I'm the black sheep when it comes to reviewing this salad.We found the vinegar far too overpowering.I even added a touch of sugar to tone it down some, but it didn't help much.Honoured to make this as a ""Thank You"" for voting for Lawrencetown, Nova Scotia in the 2010 Kraft Hockeyville Competition."
neutral,"I can't really post accurate stars because I didn't stick to the recipe.I had no chutney so I used raspberry jam.We don't have pickled onions (at least, generally at the market) around here so I used the onions fished out of the bread-n-butter pickles. And finally, our ham was not shaved thinly.However, after saying all that, these came out pretty darn good tasting and I will continue to experiment.Also, thanks for giving this American a name for stuff that comes out of the sandwich maker - it isn't quite grilled, or toasted, or panini-ed - what the heck could I call it that sounded interesting but not made up? No I will tell the kids ""Your jaffles are ready!"" and see what they say."
neutral,"I made this ahead of time and let it refrigerate overnight.This was just okay; I guess I prefer appetizers that are savory instead of sweet.I used the leftovers as a spread on bagels for breakfast, which I preferred more."
