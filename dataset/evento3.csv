negative,"Never making these again. The dough was so wet it created a horrible mess in the kitchen. Made it very difficult to work with. The final product was severely lacking in flavor, yeast rolls had more personality than these biscuits."
negative,definitely needs tikka paste for more intense flavour and wheres the handful of crushed cashews?
negative,what you need is to replace chick broth fore tikka paste (4oz) and add some cashews to make it amazing
negative,"I hate to give this a bad review, but I did not like it. It reminded me of the peanut butter and honey sandwiches i had as a kid, which was extremely off putting for me. Too sweet, not enough ginger or garlic... just couldn't get into it. If I decide to try it again, I'll use brown sugar instead of honey, use less peanut butter, and much more garlic."
negative,I made this for Christmas morning and when I woke up it was a crock pot of mush. I threw the recipe together again and baked it in the oven at 350 for a hour and it turned out better.
negative,"I wasn't a fan of this, neither it seems was anyone else judging by the leftovers.The flavours were a bit all over the place."
negative,"This is very bland and has no flavor what so ever, it smelled amazing as it was cooking but my DH hated it, the kids ate it just because I served with rice but sadly I will not be making this again!! So disappointing!"
negative,"I'm sorry to say that the creamy texture you described came out to be just gloopy.I don't know if it's because I cooked it in such a large crock pot or if the low setting on mine is hotter than yours, but the bottom was liquefied and the top had a cracked and hardened skin.It may just be my preference; I like a denser, thicker oatmeal."
negative,I used this recipe because the reviews were so good.My family all thought that it was much to sweet.It didn't do anything for my cake.I don't think that I would use this frosting again.Sorry
negative,"I'm surprised that this recipe is so popular! Each of the ingredients is delicious individually but the ingredients just don't work well together.This was beautiful when it came out of the oven and I was very optimistic when I put it out for my New Years Eve guests.Unfortunately, this dish was VERY GREASY, almost oily and slimy. It didn't hold its shape and just lay on the plate like a great oily blob.If Zero Stars had been available, I would have chosen that option."
negative,"I am sorry, Idid not care for this, there are a few other unstuffed pepper soup recipes on here I liked way better! The taco seasoning gave it a funny flavor for a stuffed green pepper soup."
negative,"This was GROSS.Inedible - I ended up throwing the whole pan away.Followed the recipe exactly, and it came out a sloppy, fake-cheese mess.I should have known, since it had Velveeta in it, but against mybetter judgment I tried it, since I could Weight Watcher-ize it.Seriously, this tastes like nacho cheese over spaghetti.Totally disgusting.Sorry."
negative,In using store bought taco seasoning my final product ended up WAY too salty and not very 'taco' tasting!I used vegetable cubes.Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.
negative,"These smell and taste great but I could not get them to set (and yes, I boiled the mixture for at least one minute). I let them cool for over an hour, then put them in an oven at 325 for 8 minutes. Still goopy. I've wasted half a can of oatmeal. Quite disappointed."
negative,"I WILL NEVER make another recipe from Ina Garten! This was the second time I've made one of her recipes, the first was her so called famous pound cake, was disappointed in it, but NOT as disappointed as I am in this cake!! I am furious!!!! Wasted ingredients and MY time. If she sold this kind of crap at her bakery, then the ""snobs"" of the Hamptons don't have a clue what is good. My DH and son said they thought it was good, but I know what a good cake is. This is not my first rodeo. So, I got that off my chest and I feel better, now. lolThere are cooks on here that would put Ina Garten to SHAME!!"
negative,"I was excited to see a muffin recipe on the south beach diet, but I have to say these were awful. I didn't find them to be sweet at all. They were one of the worst things I have ever eaten. I will stick to eggs for breakfast."
negative,"The recipe looks good, but it needs some additions. Cats need taurine. It is an essential amino acid that is vital for eyesight and heart function. This recipe needs taurine supplement added to it. Cats also need calcium. The book ""Whole Health for Happy Cats"" gives excellent instruction on dosages for these vital nutrients."
negative,"I tried this recipe and it isn't ""The Best Ever"".This pie did not set and was very runny.I personally think it calls for too much milk.It also was not sweet enough and a bit too chocolatey for my taste."
negative,This recipe would be wonderful if it were not for the sodium level in this soup. I cannot use this recipe-TOO MUCH SODIUM!Thanks!
negative,This recipe whilst tasty enough is without doubt the funniest meal I have ever cooked. My family have renamed it leaak and muesli lasagna. You should really have a go at making this recipe if only for the sheer humour value. The look on your families faces when they take that first bite will be priceless.
positive,"Oh so gooooood!This soup is so easy to make, and I really should make it more often."
positive,"Made this for dinner tonight, my roast was much bigger, so cooked it almost 12 hours. Didn't add any extra water, just the 2 cans. Good flavors."
positive,Dee-lish!Thanks for posting.It's easy and good!
positive,"This is awesome! I made recipe slightly bigger, put in a 9x13 pan sprayed with PAM, and cooked at 375 degrees for 25 minutes. Thought I wouldn't like the corn, but I did! Used 1 can of tomato paste mixed with water, b/c I didn't have sauce. Added 2 minced jalapenos. YUMMMMMMMY!"
positive,"Excellent!! I used a salmon filet because that is what I had, it still came out beautifully. So quick and easy. This is a keeper. I have made this many times since my first review and it is becoming my favorite. I give my husband a choice and he always chooses this one. Thanks Kittencal for such a great recipe. I always use your recipe first if I have a choice."
positive,We loved the combination of the shrimp and bacon.Added green onion and baked in the oven for about 20 minutes; served with a corn salsa for dinner.
positive,I made this cake on Wednesday night and this Saterday morning we ate the last piece! The cake is beautiful moist firm and slightly dense with a real smooth texture we love pecans so that is what we used instead of cherries. This is a cake I will make over and over again. Thanks for posting newspapergal!
positive,"Super quick, great texture. Added a tsp of vanilla because I was craving that box-pudding flavor. I definitely suggest ripe bananas-- mine were still a smidge green and I got that acidy taste"
positive,"So good, so easy!I made the recipeexactly as written the first time, Tonight I used buttermilk inplace of milk since I had some leftover from the holidays. The pancakes turned out scrumptiousboth times!"
positive,"This is a great base recipe.I like the way it turned out and I added some chopped up cranberries in place of the nuts.I also used crushed corn flakes as I was out of rice crispies.Thanks, I will make this one again for sure!"
positive,"Fantastic, the best savoury muffin I have made.I used a chive and garlic cream cheese and used 2 small cloves of garlic and a vegetable oil.The paper peeled of nicely without taking halve the muffin with it (my usual result).The smell was fantastic and it took a lot of will power to let them cool to warm before eating and had another cold later and it was equally delicious.Thank you Lalaloula, made for Everday A Holiday."
positive,"Yummy!I had to make a few substitutions because I am allergic to celery, and because I used ingredients I had on hand, but it was great!I think the cheese and the mayo are the key ingredients.The changes I made were whole wheat macaroni, cream of mushroom soup, some mozza cheese as well as cheddar, frozen peas and corn and fresh mushrooms.It was delicious!Thanks for the recipe!"
positive,"This was SO good! I did chicken breasts and wings, and after rolling them in the potato flakes and seasonings, let them sit for 30-40 minutes at room temp. I used a stoneware 'bar pan' to bake them on, and rather than drizzle the butter, I used a pastry brush and lightly brushed/dabbed it on. It seemed to cover the chicken better. I never had to turn the chicken over. It crunched up great top and bottom. We loved this, and I will be making this often. I am an ace at frying chicken. I learned to do that from my Mom, but I don't feel so guilty eating chicken done this way, and it's almost as good. Thank you so much for posting this great recipe!"
positive,"omgggggggggggg! ty Ellie for posting this recipe. I was given this recipe ages ago and had lost it. Was a french lady who had given it to me. Was called ( gateau chaumeur au chocolat)...It is so goooooooood! Can't wait to make it again,tyty "
positive,"WONDERFUL FAMILY DISH!!!! Had only one picky eater, but thats the norm here! Great way to get everyone to have veggies!!! Used some home made sausage, 2 small zucchini, 6oz mushrooms, 1/2 red onion, (all veggies chopped small)sauteed veggies in basil olive oil, sprinkled with ground white pepper, oregano, and saffron, 1 lg can spaghetti sauce, 2c mixed ital cheese, 1 can great northern beans, and topped casserole with 16oz crescent rolls in 9x13 inch pan.Was plenty for the four of us with leftovers!Had baked at 375 thinking that 425 would burn them. Crust was a bit doughy, as i followed the crescent roll instructions. Next time will bake at 425 and follow this recipe baking instructions. Will have to definately make again!! Thanks Ruth!!!!!"
positive,"This is gonna be my new bread pudding recipe.I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13 x 9"" pan, I had to bake it for 90 minutes. I used soft bread cubes instead of dry and I also used peaches instead of pears. Thanks Karen"
positive,"We LOVED this recipe! Thanks so much for posting it! I made it with whole almonds (a lot of them!) that I toasted in the toaster first. It was nice and crunchy, and not sticky at all. The flavor was better than any candy popcorn that I have ever had! I wish I could give it more stars!"
positive,"Great recipe, I made two batches to take to two different parties.. everyone loved them and I had many requests for the recipe.I used low fat cream cheese and reduced fat margarine. I cut the one batch in half before I dipped them in the margarine and I prefer the smaller size.Thanks! These were so easy that I am sure I will make these again."
positive,"11/08/2008 It seems like I've tried every biscuit recipe under the sun. Well, this one is the winner. My family loves them and prefers them above all the others I've tried. They're sweet but not overwhelmingly so and can accompany just about anything. The only trouble I had was making sure there was enough for everyone. LOL. Thanks for sharing. *******UPDATE******* 01/02/2010 These freeze very well. I layer them in cellophane then store in a freezer bag and remove only the biscuits I need and bake for 20 minutes in a 400 degree preheated oven. I set the oven temperature to 425 if I'm doing more than four biscuits. I make several batches so that they can easily be whipped out for Sunday brunch whenever needed (which is often). :-D"
positive,This soup is sooooo delicious. My husband raves about it and he doesn't even like spinach! This soup has changed his mind. Great recipe. I love to serve it with sourdough rolls and don't skimp on the Parmesan! I like to add a couple chopped carrots to the recipe. I have the recipe in TOH'S Big Book of Soup and it does call for 2 cans (14-1/2 ounces each) of diced tomatoes.
neutral,"3 Stars for me = Average!I made recipe exactly to specs with the exception of using 2 lbs of frozen tomatoes from my summer garden.I felt this recipe was too salty and acidic to earn above a 3.However serves as a good base to create a good sauce.Like the creator says, modify it to your taste.If I made this again, I would do like others suggested.I would recommend to cut the celery salt and replace with fresh chopped celery.2ndly I would eliminate the tomato paste, or just add 1 can and a bit more sugar to cut the high acidity which verges the recipe on the bitter side."
neutral,"Very easy pudding to make and uses everyday ingredients. I used dried currants as the fruit as I had them left-over from Christmas cooking. Also just buttered one side of the bread. Cooked up nicely and the top browned beautifully. I think the pudding needed an egg or two added to the milk as the bread underneath stayed soggy , whereas most bread 'n'butter puds will form a baked custard. Photos to be posted"
neutral,"Saffron was the reason I tried this tea, but I couldn't taste it at all.Even though I like ginger teas, I found it too overpowering here. I think if the quantities were to be adjusted it would be a really fantastic tea.Maybe just cut down on the ginger.It was fine either with or without honey."
neutral,"I cooked these beans last night for supper, 8 hr. wasn't enough time. They should have cook longer. Around 7 hours I needed to add more water. I might try it again. I am still trying to find the right baked bean. The flavor was good but I think I will leave the pepper out next time. I didn't chopped up the onion I put it in whole."
neutral,"SALTY SALT KALE CHIPS WITH SALT. I put in half the called for salt, and it was still barely edible- had to give to a salt loving friend! But I will make again, a very creative and yummy use of kale."
neutral,"Like another reviewer stated this coffee has a slightly smoky flavour. I didn't like the overall taste though and adding more white sugar just made it taste worse to me, which I guess was being out the flavour of the spices but maybe also the instant coffee's poorer taste. I made it with Original Rice Dream as we are dairy free but I do that with all my coffee's and teas so I doubt that was the problem. Made for Comfort Cafe - Snow Queen Round 01/10."
neutral,"I really thought I was going to love these, as I'm a catsup on my eggs girl. I could only eat one and that was without the soggy toast. Sorry, but these were just way too catsupy (something I never thought I'd say) for my tastes."
neutral,"This was good, but it seemed to be missing something. It was quick to fix, and that is always a plus!Thanks for sharing."
neutral,It was okay.We found the chicken to be dry.
neutral,"I didn't have caraway seeds, so I used sesame instead.I think 375* and/or 30 minutes was too high/long.Mine came out burnt.Those that weren't burnt were very bland.More salt probably would have helped."
neutral,"This took forever to cook, and never really got ""done"".It was a good idea, and I wanted it to work better, but it just didn't.I couldn't get the flavorings down into the potato enough.I wouldn't make them again."
neutral,"Good soup for a winter night if you are looking for something new to try. We thought it needed more seasoning,so I added a lot of cilantro ,ground cumin and cayenne pepper. I also added 1/2 cup of black beans for texture. It tasted better fresh,because it becomes very thick after standing in refrigerator overnight.Thank you for posting."
neutral,"This was our first foray into Ethiopian style dishes.It was simple to make.We used the small pressure cooker, and think we cooked the lentils too far down, they lost their distinct shape.Ours also ended up being hot, as we inadvertently used the Half-Sharp paprika, however, I think much Ethiopian food is hot.We are going to try this again, with the regular paprika and do them less time under pressure and will report back."
neutral,I really didn't like these. They seemed very bland and kind of dry. Maybe adding another egg would help but I don't know if I even want to bother trying again.
neutral,"This is a good recipe and easy to make.The only problem I had was that the whole thing fell apart.I followed the recipe exactly.Thanks,Donna"
neutral,"Easy, but not as moist as I had hoped (maybe due to the whole wheat flour?) and the flavor was slightly lacking.They also got stale really quickly--were very dry the second day.The pumpkin butter in the middle was a nice touch though."
neutral,"I was a little sceptical about adding the water to this dish, and I believe it did affect the texture. It came out with the consistancy of wet scrambled eggs. Although the flavor was good. If I make this again I will omit the water and just sprinkle the brown sugar over the bread cubes before adding the remaining ingredients. Thank you for the recipe."
neutral,"There was good and bad to this recipe.First the good.The chicken is great and I will continue to make this way.It has a light crisp coating without being greasy or heavy.Perfect in my opinion.The sauce however we felt was too heavy on the red pepper and we did not enjoy it.In the future when I make chicken parm, I will make the chicken using this recipe and my regular spaghetti sauce."
neutral,These didn't stick together all that well.The taste wasn't very fudge like and we ended up tossing most of it.
neutral,These were easy to make and did make quite a bit.They tasted good but were not a hit at the party I brought them too. I'll try them again another time to see how they go over. Might make a good snack.
